They could have `helptext()`, `options()`, `summary()` methods, and so on. I think that's probably necessary as a central way of handling the different ways commands can already be implemented now, and need to continue to be supported due to the \"external command\" mechanism.

I think this sounds like a nice pattern. It also keeps the help text close to the implementation, which should help with keeping the help text in sync with the code. It's initially a bit more work, as the individual parts of the man page need to be moved to the command files, but it sounds like this will pay off long term.\r\n\r\n@maxnordlund If you agree this is a sensible approach, can you maybe do that for a few commands so that we get a better idea of how the code could look like? That would also require some adjustments to `brew man` to make it assemble the complete Markdown man page from those individual snippets, then proceed to convert this generated file to `brew.1` and `brew.1.html`. If everyone is happy with how that looks, we could proceed to move the help texts for all commands.\r\n\r\n> As suggested by @bfontaine, we probably should reimplement our command system using Command class. i.e. make each internal command like:\r\n\r\nI think this is a good long-term goal, but what is being suggested here is much easier to implement and provides an immediate benefit.

		"body" : "Looks like there are a couple other issues besides the pattern for valid XML characters.\r\n\r\nThe output from the test steps is [buffered one byte at a time](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/ac8088304603a95e2ae4d187016a50c36c622605/Library/Homebrew/cmd/test-bot.rb#L158-L163), because the IO streams for the `pipe` are encoded as BINARY.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      begin\r\n        pid = fork do\r\n          read.close\r\n          $stdout.reopen(write)\r\n          $stderr.reopen(write)\r\n          write.close\r\n          working_dir.cd { exec(*@command) }\r\n        end\r\n        write.close\r\n        while buf = read.read(1)\r\n          if verbose\r\n            print buf\r\n            $stdout.flush\r\n          end\r\n          @output << buf\r\n        end\r\n      ensure\r\n        read.close\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `buf` is a `BINARY` aka `ASCII-8BIT` stream, I think that means each individual byte will be coerced to a `UTF-8` character, not code unit, when it's appended to `@output`. So multibyte UTF-8 characters will be transcoded wrong.\r\n\r\nThen later on, long output is truncated. At this point, it's a UTF-8 string, so `slice()` takes offsets in character counts. But the bounds are calculated in terms of bytes, so they may be off, and it's possible that output with lots of multibyte characters could cause the offsets to fall outside the bounds of the string, erroneously producing `nil` instead of a substring. Or if there are lots of multibyte characters, the resulting truncated string could still be significantly longer than 1 MB, which could be a problem if that 1 MB is a hard limit.\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if output.bytesize > BYTES_IN_1_MEGABYTE\r\n              output = \"truncated output to 1MB:\\n\" \\\r\n                + output.slice(-BYTES_IN_1_MEGABYTE, BYTES_IN_1_MEGABYTE)\r\n            end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorking on fixing those up as part of this.",

And I found why the issue might be occurring for this case: one of the file names in the `akka` distribution has spaces and an oddball multibyte character in its name: `akka-2.4.2/lib/akka/i have sp+ÔøΩces.jar`. Looks like it's there to exercise encoding and escaping issues just like this.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the diff in the output between the current code and my patch, it shows up as different.

Performing tab completion in brew actually makes my fans spin up.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the exact mechanism is yet, but the issue is homebrew core being a tap.  That's what is causing the unacceptably poor tab completion performance.  \r\n\r\nIt's not the aliases, nor is it having to look through stuff twice (Formula, AND the tap).  It's just the fact that is there at all.  If you remove the Formula alias in `/usr/local/Library/`, as well as the Aliases alias, tap completion performance is not improved even slightly.  It's still dog slow.\r\n\r\nIf you move the Formula directory out of the homebrew tap and *anywhere* else, then create a new symlink to it in the `/usr/local/Library` directory, homebrew's old 200ms tab completion performance immediately returns.

The error message will be sufficiently descriptive and if people come to us with that error, we'll know what to do.

		"body" : "It's worth noting that uninstalling bash completion (either the actual package or from within homebrew) removes a large number of scripts from `bash_completion.d/` and overwrites modifications etc. upon installation.  bash_completion's documentation explicitly states that user modifications to installed completion scripts in that directory will not persist over upgrades, installations, or uninstalls.  Brew's expected behavior would be to overwrite any files in that folder that it created (even if it was quite a while ago) upon an update if needed.  There is a separate folder for user modified or user created completions, `$(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/`.  \r\n\r\nI think is actually a valid concern, I've seen a lot of people who do some pretty terrible things in the name of 'ricing' their shell, like aliasing cp to call rsync, or having `` `which python` `` return a bash script that would return a path instead of a path, and I'm sure there is at least one unfortunate bastard out there who is sourcing this homebrew file, and in his system-wide bash profile, not just his user account.\r\n\r\nBut, noting what I said in the first paragraph, we could simply over write the file with an empty one, thus solving the problem without causing Mr. Unfortunate Bastard a very bad day. \r\n\r\nAn even safer option might be to only do that if it is unchanged from the original homebrew-legacy script (this would need to be a manual check I think - but it could just pull it in from github or a gist to do the check), and if there are changes, move it  elsewhere, symlink it into `bash_completion.d/`, track it with git in its new home (since a .git folder in `bash_completions.d/` would be no bue√±o), and emit the familiar 'git stash pop' warning about user changes.  \r\n\r\nA solution I am not nearly as big a fan of, but is probably the simplest, safest, and also least effective, is to just add a `brew doctor` check for the file that recommends the user remove it manually.  \r\n\r\nJust some ideas. I have no feeling for what they think is 'ok' or not for homebrew to do, but I tried to think up things that, while involved, would minimize the invasiveness.  *shrug*",

		"body" : "Am out & about, so will give more feedback later, but one quick thing to be aware of: \"bash completion\" can mean two things in Homebrew land. There's `brew`'s own support for bash completion, and there's the `bash-completion` formula, which is a separate project that provides completions for many commands. These two things are independent. \"Uninstalling bash completion\" and the `$(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d` sounds like you're referring to the `bash-completion` formula stuff. Brew's own bash completion support gets installed directly to `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew`, should be independent of the `bash-completion` formula, and there is no support for uninstallation of it.\r\n\r\n(There's a [similar issue with `zsh-completion` vs \"zsh completion\"](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/49066).)\r\n\r\nThe stuff about leaving user modifications alone to \"bash_completion\" might be from `bash-completion`'s own doco. AFAIK, `brew`'s bash completion does not support user modification at all. And, as a separate issue, the way we install `bash-completion` might be messing with their support for unmolested user modifications, but I don't think that's the problem this GitHub issue is addressing.\r\n\r\nWill give this a close reading and feedback later tonight.",

We announced the deprecation of `sha1` 18+ months in advance of that being enforced later this year. We let `md5` sit around for several years with warnings prior to killing it last year and _that still_ \"snuck up\" on more than a few tap owners.\r\n\r\nThere's no medium we can use that every Homebrew user will see or remember to check, sadly.

		"body" : "I think we can agree, that this PR on the one hand tries to solves a lot of issues with the current way we handle node modules based formulas, but unfortunately on the other hand introduces a new big issue through the big amount of dependencies it produces, which homebrew can't handle well enough atm. Also some :white_check_mark: (but not all :red_circle:) of the identified issues can be solved in another way too (without moving completely away from npm based installs). An example on how an improved formula can look like can be found [here for azure-cli](https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-node/blob/master/Formula/azure-cli2.rb). I think we should move the discussion now more in the direction of these issues, which I've summarized bellow:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Online requirement during installs (Refs [this comment](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/50167#issuecomment-198751313)) :red_circle:\r\n* only fixable by homebrew managed resource dependencies as proposed by this PR\r\n\r\n#### 2. Global vs local module installations :white_check_mark:\r\n* Independent of what way we choose, we should switch our module installation from local style to global style (with setting a custom prefix to libexec) as in [this line]( https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-node/blob/master/Formula/azure-cli2.rb#L39)\r\n* this brings our installations more in line with global installations through npm\r\n* prunes the obsoletly installed devDependencies (which are unnecessarily installed with our current local installations) and\r\n* uses npm for spec conform bin command name resolution (instead of relying on the developer to have a 1:1 mapping in a bin folder)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Locking dependencies to specific versions :white_check_mark:\r\n* atm when reinstalling the same version of the formula (from source) after a week you will get a completely different dependencies tree, because deps are only locked to semver ranges with the current approve\r\n* this can either be fixed by homebrew managed resource deps (as proposed by this PR) or by providing a `npm-shrinkwrap.json` as [done here](https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-node/blob/master/Formula/azure-cli2.rb#L32)\r\n* this would require the generation of a new `npm-shrinkwrap.json` with every version upgrade by running `npm shrinkwrap` inside a global installation and updating the gist\r\n\r\n#### 4. Handling of the npm cache :white_check_mark:\r\n* atm the npm cache location gets overwritten by superenv to point to `buildpath/.brew_home/.npm` instead of `~/.npm`\r\n* this results in over 10x higher build times than necessary making the current approve even less performant than the resource heavy approve proposed by this PR\r\n* to fix this (while sticking with npm based installs) we need to tell npm the real location of it's global cache (and not our fake `buildpath/.brew_home/.npm` cache)\r\n* a workaround for this can [be found here](https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-node/blob/master/Formula/azure-cli2.rb#L35-L37) (Can this be improved somehow (can we access the old home?)?)\r\n\r\n#### 5. NPM is not designed as a package manager for global installations :red_circle:\r\n* NPM is optimized for the local installation use case and because of this is not creating optimized global installations (it's not an issue but the proposed way is quite an enchantment)\r\n* the node module spec compliant format proposed in this PR is in 2 ways better than the global format produced by npm:\r\n  * 100% flat (no nested dependencies, just symlinks to their locations)\r\n  * no duplications (Npm produces multiple copies of the same version of a dependency if it's required at different nested places. In the proposed format we would just create multiple symlinks from our versioned dep to the places where it is needed, resulting in smaller installation sizes)\r\n\r\n### 6. Handling of native addons (inside the dependency tree)\r\n\r\n#### 6.1 Not pulling prebuild binaries :red_circle:\r\n* Solutions like [node-pre-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pre-gyp) or [prebuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prebuild) for pulling prebuild binaries for native addons are not compatible with homebrews philosophy to build everything from source on the CI / in `--build-from-source` builds. That's why I have a system in place in this PR for patching the installation step of native addons to tell such tools to always build from source.\r\n* Unfortunately it's is not possible to avoid pulling prebuild binaries of c-code for native addons if we stick with npm install based formula installations.\r\n\r\n#### 6.2 bottle compatibility with same major node version :white_check_mark:\r\n* native addons compiled against a Node version are only compatible with other Node version with the same major version (other Node version are not ABI compatible)\r\n* thats why we should consider adding a `pour_bottle?` requirement for native addons like [done here](https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-node/blob/master/Formula/azure-cli2.rb#L17-L22) for a specific node major version\r\n* also a build time dep to python 2.6/2.7 is required too\r\n",

Global vs local module installations)\r\n\r\n> Seems like a good idea :+1: However, the location should be somewhere under HOMEBREW_CACHE; we don't want to provide write-access to $HOME during install. We could consider copying files in there from $HOME/.npm at some point.\r\n\r\nI think I might have an idea of what is causing the current `npm install` slowness. If no explicit cache path is set npm tries to resolve `~/.npm` both in it's main process and it's spawned child processes, but only it's main process is affected by the homebrew patched `ENV[\"HOME\"]` by superenv. This results in a edge case because the cache is resolved to `buildpath/.brew_home/./npm` in the main process, but in the spawned child processes it's resolved to the actual `/Users/username/.npm`.\r\n\r\nSetting the cache to somewhere inside `HOMEBREW_CACHE` doesn't seem to decrease the performance to much. These are the install times of `azure-cli` on a MBA 2012 (with a decent internet connection):\r\n* with prefilled cache in `~/.npm`: ~45sec\r\n* with empty cache in a tmp dir: ~50sec\r\n* with unset cache causing edge case: aborted after 20 min (after running out of my 10gb free disk space)\r\n\r\nDo you think the simple `HOMEBREW_CACHE/.npm` would be a good location or do you have something better in mind? Also do you think that this (and 2. global style module installation) would be worth creating a `Language::Node` helper similar to pythons `setup_install_args` which sets the cache (by creating a local `.npmrc` file with the cache entry set) and returning our npm install args for the global style (`\"npm\", \"install\", \"--global\", \"--prefix=#{libexec}\", \"--verbose\", buildpath`)?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Online requirement during installs + 3. Locking dependencies to specific versions \r\n\r\nOk, than I take this as a wont fix, because fixing it would add to much overhead.\r\n\r\n#### 5. NPM is not designed as a package manager for global installations\r\n\r\n> I think this is something that's better taken upstream to npm.\r\n\r\nI disagree here. While it's not a common use case to update only a resource of a formula in homebrew, updating only specific dependencies is quite common in npm. What I meant here was, that we could optimize the module format more for the homebrew use case as it could be done for a npm use case. \r\nBut I think it's like 1 and 3 something we can't improve without adding to much overhead.\r\n\r\n#### 6.1 Native addons: Not pulling prebuild binaries\r\n\r\n> Again, this is regrettable but not that serious, currently, and should be taken upstream to npm.\r\n\r\nNpm official only supports building native addons from source. These are both 3rd party solutions and it might be worth asking them to add an environment variable to force source builds, which we could set.\r\n\r\n#### 6.2 bottle compatibility with same major node version\r\n\r\n> We don't actually need that requirement; depends_on \"node\" means that we can rely on the newest version of node always being installed before the package is installed (even if they are pinned). This would only be required if we had a :node or similar that allowed using Nodes from homebrew-versions.\r\n\r\nAgreed.

		"body" : "### Summary:\r\n\r\nThis mostly looks reasonable, from testing. I like the way it ended up. Added a few comments but there's nothing enormous.\r\n\r\nI agree with Mike in particular that avoiding adding a wad of resources to every `npm`-using formula was an important step to getting this üö¢-able; we've discovered that heavy resource use on things like Python formulae tends to result in people not updating them unless something explicitly breaks, which is a solid way to end up missing upstream resource security or bugfix releases.\r\n\r\nIt is an annoyance that many formulae can be fetched and then installed offline, and then some very much cannot, and that's something I'd like to eventually see if we can stamp out. I consider it a lesser evil  though to require someone to be online than implementing another system where resource security updates are potentially missed.\r\n\r\n### Improvements:\r\n\r\nOne thing that would be nice to prevent is `.brew_home` being coped into every `npm`-using formula's `libexec/lib/node_modules/name` under the new system. It shouldn't cause any harm, but it could be confusing to users and is unnecessary clutter.\r\n\r\nThat directory will always contain at least a blob of folders followed by one file, the Python helper that makes sure Homebrew's `site-packages` for Python remain accessible to the system Python, as documented [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/acc9a7ca8554bc2413dee2d6d0f407b3a59c628c/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb#L1373-L1381).\r\n\r\n### Things that'd be nice to handle one day:\r\n\r\nOne thing that does make me wonder if we've room for improvement are these comments in some formulae such as [here](https://github.com/chrmoritz/homebrew-core/blob/a568583597a58fa11e0b0a590861d886d205c39c/Formula/azure-cli.rb):\r\n> needs a revision for every node major version bump (native addon)\r\n\r\nI worry a bit that a lot of people are going to forget those lines exist and we'll end up doing revisions after-the-fact (if at all) rather than at-the-time.\r\n\r\nIt's probably overly complex and we may just have to live with this new mechanism being an improvement in stability over the status quo but it'd be nice if `audit` detected Node was being bumped more than x amount (which should be easy enough given Node's versioning system) and there weren't expected changes to formulae with that notation.\r\n\r\nI don't think that idea is particularly workable immediately though, it's more of a \"nice to have in future\" than \"let's get this done today\".",

We could prob do a bulk search-and-replace of `:revision => \"\\w+\"` since nothing else uses that symbol AFAIK, and formatting is consistent. I can't easily think of another term to use for formula revisions, but maybe that's just because I'm used to it now.\r\n\r\nThough semantically and conversationally, it might be cleaner to change the terms for formula and bottle: since we track our formulae in git, and don't bump the formula revision with every file change, a formula revision may live for several git revisions of the formula file. And all the git revisions of a formula file over its life do not correspond to \"revisions\" of that formula. (E.g. If I say \"what revision of asciidoc are you looking at?\" I might be referring to the git revision SHA of `asciidoc.rb` or the `revision 2` inside the file.

I think those taps would find this comment more abrasive than a DSL change.\r\n\r\nThat's good to know and makes the decision you've made when creating the above three PRs feel less arbitrary. Another similar idea that just popped into my head would be to move the `bottle do` block further down to reduce this kind of confusion. It could become the last element in `class Foo < Formula [‚Ä¶] end` or could even be moved into a separate code block at the end of the file (by relying on the ability to reopen classes in Ruby):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Foo < Formula\r\n  # Formula code created by a human.\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Foo\r\n  bottle do\r\n    # Bottle code typically created by `brew test-bot`/`brew bottle`.\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne possible downside is that this repeats the class name. An upside is that this is far easier to cut out and replace with a new `bottle do` block compared to the current regex solution.\r\n\r\n> That said, given you've scoped the problem as being just about the bottle block, I'm prepared to make just a change there for now. Do you have any other suggested names for `bottle_revision` that would be more clearly about the bottle and not the formula? Alternatively, do you have a suggestion for what to change `formula_revision` to (technically `revision`s for bottles predate `revisions` for formulae if that's at all relevant).\r\n\r\nIn general, I find a solution that keeps the (formula) `revision` as-is (for the benefit of all the contributors that have already understood this) and only changes the DSL used inside the `bottle do` block more desirable. The latter could be more easily seen as an implementation detail and if it changes, it doesn't really affect contributors (except for causing less confusion).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this might cause new confusion, but `build` feels like a nice replacement for a bottle `revision`. After all it is indeed a new (binary) build of an otherwise unchanged formula with the same `pkgversion` (version+revision). If we stray a bit into book printing territory, `reissue` could also work.

Remove/unlink a brewed `git` as that will be in PATH and probably will prevent the bug from happening.

Apply this patch to the `xz` formula (random choice, something that downloads and extracts quickly):\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  diff --git i/Formula/xz.rb w/Formula/xz.rb\r\n  index 1e27e044..a9908005 100644\r\n  --- i/Formula/xz.rb\r\n  +++ w/Formula/xz.rb\r\n  @@ -16,7 +16,10 @@ class Xz < Formula\r\n\r\n     option :universal\r\n\r\n  +  env :userpaths\r\n     def install\r\n  +    puts ENV[\"PATH\"].inspect\r\n  +    system \"git\", \"--version\"\r\n       ENV.universal_binary if build.universal?\r\n       system \"./configure\", \"--disable-debug\",\r\n                             \"--disable-dependency-tracking\",\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n4.

I am running under the sandbox, and was logging to `/Users/brew/Library/Logs/Homebrew/scm_git.log`, which would have been denied. That's consistent with some of the `git` calls getting killed and fixing the hang.\r\n\r\nThough when I ran `test-bot` like that, I was getting log output at that location, with a lot of `git --version` entries in it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nelcapitanvm-2:Homebrew brew$ pwd\r\n/Users/brew/Library/Logs/Homebrew\r\nelcapitanvm-2:Homebrew brew$ head log-01.txt\r\nexec-ing /usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git: [\"/usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git\", \"--version\"]\r\nexec-ing /usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git: [\"/usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git\", \"--version\"]\r\nexec-ing /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git: [\"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git\", \"--version\"]\r\nexec-ing /usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git: [\"/usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git\", \"--version\"]\r\nexec-ing /usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git: [\"/usr/local/Library/ENV/scm/git\", \"--version\"]\r\nexec-ing /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git: [\"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git\", \"--version\"]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbably enough `git` calls from outside sandboxed calls were getting recorded to produce the logs, and the ones run under it were getting denied.

		"body" : "Yeah, adding tests will help in some cases. And minimizing options in the first place will help.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Add `test do` blocks to all your formulae so `test-bot` can test them when upgrading their dependencies. Probably would have caught those two breaks before they happened.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nThe Homebrew/homebrew-science#3454 `ceres-solver` breakage looks like it was a dylib version linkage problem. It didn't get caught first time around because `ceres-solver` did not have a `test do`. Adding a `test do`, even a basic one like `--version`, will generally be enough to catch dylib linkage problems for direct dependencies, because when we test a version bump PR, that includes testing all the bottled dependents. (At least the ones with direct dependencies.) For this kind of breakage, making sure all formulae have tests, even if they're trivial tests, will help. `brew audit` now requires a `test do` for all formulae, so we're making progress there.\r\n\r\nHomebrew/homebrew-science#3512 PCL doesn't have a `test do` in its formula either, so it's not being tested when its dependencies change. I can't tell from skimming that issue whether it was a dylib version problem or a different issue, but a test might have caught it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what happens in `test_bot` when testing a PR for `foo` and there's a testable `bar` with `depends_on \"foo\" => \"with-some-option\"`. For dependencies besides the tested formula, it will install the dependency with the option. But I'm not sure what happens when the dep is the formula under test. It probably should reinstall it with that option. It probably doesn't do it 100% correctly now: our dependency resolution isn't perfect, and it's something we're working to get more robust in the longer term.\r\n\r\nThe full solution of testing all combinations of options is prohibitively expensive. (Testing N options takes N or 2^N runs, depending on how thorough you are.)\r\n\r\nWe could do a smaller version where we just test the option combinations which are used in `depends_on xxx => \"with_foo\"` dependencies in the central taps. (And maybe we effectively already do, depending on how the test-bot dependency resolution works.) But even that could blow up the test bots: we're already pushing run time limits with larger formulae that have lots of dependencies, and that's where some of the dependencies with options happen. Could be helped by having test-bot examine the dependents and consolidate dependents that need options toward the end of the list, to avoid redundant builds. Calculating that could get hairy once indirect dependencies are considered, though.\r\n\r\nWe could also detect dylib versions by interrogating files with `otool` and storing that data for bottles some where. But that would introduce a whole new data set for `brew` to manage, and would be mostly redundant with `test do` blocks, which we want to encourage, and which can test more things. So I don't think we'd want to do that.\r\n\r\nThe best immediate approach is probably \"make sure all your formulae have `test`s\". I think that would have caught both of the issues you're referencing here.\r\n\r\nOpen to other suggestions. I may have blinders on for this issue since I'm so used to looking at `test-bot` throughput limitations.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: Note that this ability is currently limited because we're not using `uses --recursive` in the `test-bot`, for performance reasons.

See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/issues/2544#issuecomment-208770839.\r\n\r\nWhile having the repos all separate is great for separation of concerns, it's a little troublesome to update a library in `homebrew-core` that other formulae depend on from other repos. In `icu4c`'s case, we've got dependants in `homebrew-php`, `homebrew-games`, `homebrew-science`, and `homebrew-core` itself.\r\n\r\nDealing with the `homebrew-core` dependents is easy: just ensure that the pull request also includes revision bumps for all formulae that have an explicit (non-optional) dependency on `icu4c`. The existing CI infrastructure works well to tell you if there are any formulae in `homebrew-core` that need to have their bottles remade (provided, of course, that they actually have tests defined. Let's just assume that they do for now, for the sake of argument).\r\n\r\nDealing with the other repos' dependents is harder. CI currently does detect the breaks in the other repos. While we can immediately issue pull requests on those repos as soon as the version bump is merged into `homebrew-core` (which is what I did for this `icu4c` version bump), there is still going to be a window of time where packages in the other repos will break because of the dependency version bump. (Only one of the two pull requests in the other repos has merged, so currently there are packages that are broken because they are looking for the older version of icu4c in `homebrew-games` and `homebrew-science`.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the right way to solve this. One option would be to somehow coordinate between the repositories so that all of the library-version-bump-related PRs are merged (nearly) simultaneously. This seems hard to do, though, since unpredictable CI errors do happen (something builds just fine locally, but not on e.g. a different OS X version).\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have the formulae that list `icu4c` as a dependency specify a specific version that they target. In theory, couldn't `brew` then detect that installing a newer `icu4c` formula would break the existing formulae installed on the system that have not been updated and either spout a warning or just outright bail from updating `icu4c` until they're ready?",

		"body" : "> Do you modify the original formula and bump the revisions of the dependents all in the same commit?\r\n\r\nThe one vs many commits is more a stylistic issue. Regardless of how many commits it is, for formulae in the same repo, all the commits go in the same PR which is merged all-or-nothing, so they're tested and committed as a unit, and users will pick up all of them in the same `brew update`, so there's never a time when they are out of sync for a given Homebrew installation.\r\n\r\nBut for formulae in separate repos, skystrife hits it on the head:\r\n\r\n> While having the repos all separate is great for separation of concerns, it's a little troublesome to update a library in homebrew-core that other formulae depend on from other repos. \r\n> ...\r\n> While we can immediately issue pull requests on those repos as soon as the version bump is merged into homebrew-core (which is what I did for this icu4c version bump), there is still going to be a window of time where packages in the other repos will break because of the dependency version bump.\r\n\r\nWe do not have a mechanism for linking PRs across repos, testing them together, or making sure they get tested and deployed as a unit. So the current mechanism actually requires this out-of-sync window, because the PRs for dependent repos' revision bumps can only be run in CI *after* the version bumps to `core` are committed. (And since we only have 1 CI worker per OS, the PRs for multiple dependent repos must be serialized. And wait on whatever other CI traffic there is.)\r\n\r\nI don't know how to solve this currently. I think that \"coordinating between repositories\" would require adding some special metadata in PRs that `brew test-bot` recognized and used to test them as a unit. It's `brew test-bot`, not Jenkins code, which pulls in the formula PRs for testing, so that could be solved with custom Homebrew code, and not require GitHub and Jenkins to support it. But probably non-trivial.\r\n\r\nThe limiting factor here is again whether the dependent formulae are testable. Right now, that means having a `test do` block. So, no `test do` in a dependent, and we still wouldn't see the breakage reported in a test run. I don't have numbers to support this, but I suspect most of the dependency-version breakage users are actually encountering is probably due to lack of testing, and not repo synchronization. The sync breakage window is maybe an hour or so. The breakage window for a dependent that is missing a `test do` is until somebody notices it's broken, reports it, and gets a revision-bump PR through. And unfortunately it's probably going to be a user noticing it in this case. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we could also add an automatic dylib linkage test that's done regardless of whether a `test do` is defined: install the dependents, check each with `brew linkage`, and consider broken link references to be a test failure. That way all dependents, regardless of their `test do` definition, will have dylib version breakage caught.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are probably necessary to get to a \"perfect\" state, because they're independent sources of possible breakage. (Plus restoring `--recursive` to `brew uses`, or flattening all dependencies.)\r\n\r\n> couldn't brew then detect that installing a newer icu4c formula would break the existing formulae\r\n\r\nIIRC, `brew` actually does something like this already: it checks for dylib linkage, and if the old version of `icu4c` has installed formulae still linked to its versioned dylibs, it will not be uninstalled until those dependencies have been uninstalled. For Homebrew installations with existing formula installations, it's the removal of the old version, not installation of the new version, which breaks things.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cover the case of keeping bottles in sync, though: the case that breaks more often is when you do a fresh installation of `icu4c` and some dependents. In that case, there's no prior installation for `brew` to hold on to for dylib linkage reasons.",

We start moving libraries and system services (not end-user applications or GUIs) that have dependencies in the Homebrew org to being versioned on the next major upgrade. e.g. if Boost 2.0.0 was released tomorrow we'd make a `boost20` formula which is merged immediately without trying to upgrade anything that depends on `boost`.\r\n3. After the `boost20` formula is merged in a PR we create a new PR to change all dependencies that can be build with `boost20` from `boost` and rename the old formula to `boost15` and give `boost20` the `boost` alias. Anything that doesn't build with `boost20` doesn't block anything. \r\n4. At some point in the future if we're on e.g. `boost30` or something (having had `boost21` etc.) we remove any formulae from core that still depend on `boost15` and remove the `boost15` formula itself.\r\n\r\nThis may need to have some `revision`s applied and bottles rebuild in the process but this would be no worse than any current upgrade and paves the way for this to be smoother in future. This also may not even need to be done depending on how the linkage is found at runtime.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Concerns? I realise this is a big departure from Homebrew's previous versions support but I think we need to change due to concerns raised in this issue and also to provide people who want it a more stable base to say things like e.g. `install mysql 5.7 today but don't upgrade anyone to mysql 5.8` in `Brewfile`s.",

That would fix the cross-tap decoupling synchronization issue without requiring special GitHub/Jenkins customization. And even within a single repo, it would be useful: by avoiding a single \"flag day\" where everything has to cut over, it would let the upgrades happen without waiting for every last dependent to fix compatibility, so users get the new stuff without waiting for the slowest-dev-cycle application. And it would let us safely split the revision bump updates in to multiple PRs, avoiding the worst 5+ hour test-bot scenarios, and making it easier for multiple authors to work on doing the upgrade work and testing (since PRs have a single owner/committer).\r\n\r\nI think I like this versioning approach better than my idea of adding cross-PR linkage at the PR and test-bot level, because it builds the associations in to Homebrew and formulae themselves, and not just into the GitHub-based workflow. Plus it would support a wider range of valid configurations.\r\n\r\nSome packages are kind of both libraries and applications, in that they install commands. `mysql` is probably a good example. How would we handle side-by-side installation of those? Would we version-suffix the command names, and switch those around when the new `mysql58` becomes the \"main\" installation? To do this, I think we do need to support side-by-side installation of all versioned variants of a formula.\r\n\r\nA big change here is that these formulae would only be available in versioned variants, instead of having the versioned variants supplement a main formula. For users who install it for direct use, e.g. with `brew install mysql`, a `brew upgrade` might no longer get them to the latest version of it, because that `mysql` would have been resolved to `mysql57` at install time. And that's probably not what they want. (That is, we need to remember whether the user did `brew install mysql` or `brew install mysql57`, and alias resolution lose that info, I think.)\r\n\r\n\"Virtual packages\" ‚Äì a formula that contains no files itself, but just has dependencies or references ‚Äì might fix this. (I think you and some other people have been down on them before as added complexity, but with this versioning change, the complexity might be justified.) `mysql` could be a virtual package instead of an alias, and it would contain or `depends_on` the \"current\" versioned `mysqlNN` variant. That way formulae could specify exact version dependencies, but a user could still request \"the latest mysql\" and have that keep up with new versioned formulae across `update; upgrade` cycles.\r\n\r\nCan a formula `depend_on` an alias?

Perhaps adding multi revision support in single formulae, and particularly revision dependencies directly to formulas would help?\r\n\r\nForgiving my likely botched ruby syntax but perhaps versions could be something like  the following or another cleaner idea:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nurl \"https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst.git\", :tag => \"1.0.5\", :version => \"1.0.5\"\r\nurl1.0 \"https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst.git\", :tag => \"1.0\", :version => \"1.0.0\"\r\n```\r\ndependencies could be something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndepends_on \"opencv\",  :version => \"3.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI generally deal with packages with a deep tree of dependencies which substantially increases the chance of breakage as it grows. I sometimes also work with ROS (robot operating system) infrastructure which is in the same situation. I personally know at least 4 other users that have encountered these issues and I've seen posts from several others I don't personally know.\r\n\r\nHere are some posts where these types of problems are mentioned by others:\r\n\r\n#### [VTK dep issue that led to this feature request](https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx/issues/32)\r\n\r\nThis is the original issue for which I created this, there are comments about this type of problem by other users there.\r\n\r\n#### [Breakage when tools depend on brew (rosdep)](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/444) \r\n\r\nI created the issue, other brew users are discussing how to handle the problem. For example:\r\n\r\n>  @mikepurvis [april 17](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/444#issuecomment-211107330)\r\n> I'm curious to know how other rolling release systems like Arch deal with this kind of thing. Homebrew is always on the bleeding edge of everything, which basically guarantees some level of brokenness, at least as far as new major versions with breaking changes. That said, a disproportionate number of issues seem to come up around bottled versions of things with baked-in paths to their dependencies, that then go stale when those depended-upon packages move on‚Äî we've seen this with Python, VTK, PCL, CMake, and probably others. It feels like there's a fundamental issue there with Homebrew, that it should have a dependency type for \"rebottle when this dependency updates\".\r\n> \r\n> In any case, if upstream Homebrew can't commit to a satisfactory level of stability across the rather large base of packages upon which we depend, then I don't see much choice other than to maintain at least some of the system in taps. Random assorted thoughts on this direction:\r\n> \r\n> Unless we are also committed to bottling stuff, the cost to users of building big dependencies like VTK and PCL locally is pretty big‚Äî my understanding is that bottling is not hard; you just have to set it up.\r\n> Certain dependencies (CMake, Python) are not realistic to maintain in taps due to the weirdness of a system with multiple versions of these things.\r\n> It may be possible to build some light Travis-based tooling to provide notification of upstream formulae changes, so we can hopefully mitigate a bit the issue of stuff falling behind.\r\n> Maintaining any of this will be nightmare without regular CI builds across the supported OS X versions. I know OSRF had expressed interest last year in doing some of this around ros-install-osx, but it didn't seem to go anywhere.\r\n\r\n#### [comments on duplicating formula for versions](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ros-sig-ng-ros/FjypP8jLj_w/lzMGl1gDBwAJ)\r\n\r\n>Steven Peters \tApr 16\r\n>\r\n>It is indeed very easy to set up your own homebrew tap to host your own custom packages. It's harder, though, to put version constraints on dependencies (for example requiring an older version of boost). The current state-of-the-art is to create a duplicate formula (such as boost155) typically hosted in homebrew/duplicates. I don't consider this a very elegant approach.\r\n>\r\n>It is true that they allow customizable builds (such as --double-precision for bullet), and you can declare these options in your dependencies (gazebo requests that double-precision option from bullet). Using that example, if you install gazebo and bullet is not installed, it will install bullet with the requested options. If bullet is already installed, however, it won't check whether it has the desired configuration, it will just use it.\r\n>\r\n>Don't get me wrong, I love homebrew very much. I just think it's not trying to do everything that debian does, so it's important to keep that in mind.",

And the main PR would never go green. But at least now you'd have a programmatically-generated list of the things to bump, and it doesn't require `test do` to make it happen.\r\n\r\nIndirect dependencies across taps are also not picked up since we're not doing `uses --recursive`, and the main PR would never be iterated to include the revision bumps for the intermediate dependencies. Most indirect dependencies within a single repo *will* be caught, because iterating the PR to revision bump direct dependents with breakage will expand the list of formulae changed in the PR, pulling in more formulae as direct dependents of the PR's scope, and eventually getting to a transitive closure, as long as each formulae actually has a dylib link to its dependent, not just a command other runtime dependency.",

		"body" : "Sorry, submitted too early:\r\n\r\n> Some packages are kind of both libraries and applications, in that they install commands. mysql is probably a good example. How would we handle side-by-side installation of those? Would we version-suffix the command names, and switch those around when the new mysql58 becomes the \"main\" installation? To do this, I think we do need to support side-by-side installation of all versioned variants of a formula.\r\n\r\nI think side-by-side installation is a good goal but keg-only gives us a bit of a hammer we can use to get around it in the short-term. For `mysql` I see us suffixing the binary names and data directories but probably not e.g. ports.\r\n\r\n> A big change here is that these formulae would only be available in versioned variants, instead of having the versioned variants supplement a main formula. For users who install it for direct use, e.g. with brew install mysql, a brew upgrade might no longer get them to the latest version of it, because that mysql would have been resolved to mysql57 at install time. And that's probably not what they want. (That is, we need to remember whether the user did brew install mysql or brew install mysql57, and alias resolution lose that info, I think.)\r\n\r\nYeh, we'd probably need a little be of syntactical sugar on top to handle this case of someone installing from an alias. I think this is the only code that _needs_ to be written.\r\n\r\n> \"Virtual packages\" ‚Äì a formula that contains no files itself, but just has dependencies or references ‚Äì might fix this. (I think you and some other people have been down on them before as added complexity, but with this versioning change, the complexity might be justified.) mysql could be a virtual package instead of an alias, and it would contain or depends_on the \"current\" versioned mysqlNN variant. That way formulae could specify exact version dependencies, but a user could still request \"the latest mysql\" and have that keep up with new versioned formulae across update; upgrade cycles.\r\n\r\nI kinda hate virtual packages. They smell bad to me as a formula file but we could introduce some other element that would allow them. Aliases may be sufficient here but we may want to introduce another directory for versioned aliases whilst relying on the same underlying technology.\r\n\r\n> Can a formula depend_on an alias? We should preserve back-compatibility for formulae in taps outside the central Homebrew ones.\r\n\r\nThey can, yes.\r\n\r\n> In any case, if upstream Homebrew can't commit to a satisfactory level of stability across the rather large base of packages upon which we depend, then I don't see much choice other than to maintain at least some of the system in taps.\r\n\r\n@mikepurvis Homebrew relies on internal and upstream stability rather than external stability. That is:\r\n\r\n- We do not install upstream development versions or snapshots as stable versions\r\n- We ensure that within Homebrew/homebrew-core we do not break things when we bump versions\r\n\r\nWe do not provided guaranteed stable versions so you can \"sit on\" a particular version of software indefinitely. I'd like us to provide that guarantee for libraries and some service applications based on major/minor (not patch) semver but if you need more than that: I doubt we'll be able to provide it, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n> If bullet is already installed, however, it won't check whether it has the desired configuration, it will just use it.\r\n\r\n@scpeters This is not accurate, it will be reinstalled if you request an option it was not built with.",

We can use this to go through `homebrew/science` to clean up formulae and add missing tests, making more of them testable so they get covered by `test-bot` when there are changes.

But what if something depends on the old db version (the whole point), do you have to create a cluster from all versions and sync the data constantly? Because that often isn't possible across DB versions (every database I've ever used has done this at one point or another; opentsdb/influx/mysql/postgres just recently). If you want to avoid a huge support nightmare I'd steer away from that idea hard. It's already hard enough to talk to the postgres/mysql people because homebrew's not a blessed/supported config so they can just point at that and not help.\r\n\r\nI think there's a lot of good that could come from versioning some libraries but please please please don't do it to the databases.",

Its a pretty simple hack, just replacing every instance of `\"./configure\"` with `./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --with-pic` for autotools-based formulae, and adding `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0` to `\"cmake\"` for cmake-based based formulae.\r\n\r\n This (obviously) takes care of this issue (and most other linkage headaches) for 95% of the formulae _I use_, and (in most likelihood) at least half of all formulae in general. For the rest I use `--interactive` to eliminate dynamic linkage manually.\r\n\r\nThere are _so_ many reasons to do this, the most important of which, for me, as I'm developing my own software, is to avoid [things like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline#Choice_of_the_GPL_as_GNU_Readline.27s_license); but when developing an app/program that will be distributed in binary form, I actually don't really understand how anyone would be able to use homebrew **without** doing something like this.",

		"body" : "Oh!\r\n\r\nIn the past I've had several unpleasant run-ins with some homebrew maintainers who vociferously advocated for dynamically linking as much as possible (that issue I linked above doesn't address this exact idea per se, but I trust you can gather my meaning). I have thus largely avoided proposing _anything_ related to what is now the \"brew\" repo, for some time now. I have even avoided putting anything in a public fork: my worry was someone might come across it, adopt it, and suddenly a few weeks I'd be maintaining a fork to which the upstream maintainers were diametrically opposed.\r\n\r\nBut I know there's been a significant \"changing of the guard\" since that period, so, if you're serious:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are actually several \"side-advantages\" of doing this as well, namely,\r\n-  _Many, many_ formulae that are now either keg-only or in  `-dupes` no longer need be so, because there is no issue any with library paths or such nonsense, nor worries about ABI compatibility with system libraries. I actually usually intentionally shadow some system libraries. For example, I can (and do) use the [newer, and significantly faster](http://opensource.apple.com/source/bzip2/bzip2-38/bzip2/arm64/crc32vec.s) whilst also being able to target older SDKs (I usually build against 10.7). And I even have fully-linked, non-sequestered *libiconv* installed, _believe it or not_ üòà.\r\n\r\nI get faster code and great compatibility across systems. All it costs me is a few kb's in my executables.\r\n\r\n- It also makes a homebrew install _almost_ completely portable between directories and systems. I don't having to worry about `instal_name_tool -change`ing thousands of executables and libraries. I have an expanded `brew` script that basically:\r\n    1. Caches its own location, and checks to make sure it hasn't been moved since the last invocation.\r\n    2. If it detects a move, it 'grep-and-sed's any references to the location that exist in text files (we're basically only talking about `.pc` files, then reinstalls openssl, which is one a small handful of formulae that hardcode their absolute paths within the binaries themselves.\r\n\r\n- It also makes cross-platform compatibility significantly less painful. I use the same basic principal (and a lot of the same code) with a **very** modified `linuxbrew` that produces binaries and libraries that are largely interchangeable between distros.\r\n\r\nPresently, the code I have is pretty crude, and mostly consists of shell scripts that copy formulae to a temporary directory, 'grep-and-sed's as appropriate; then installs the formula using a `file://` URI.\r\n\r\nSo, if indeed this is something you'd want to consider experimenting with, I'd be happy to clean it all up and implement it in Ruby for something you could pull into a topic branch...?\r\n",

It's intended to be used for interactive `brew test-bot` runs where you're trying to locally reproduce and diagnose a failure.\r\n\r\n> Couldn't those complications (and the use of class variables) be avoided by making Mktemp#run yield the Mktemp instance to the invoking code?\r\n\r\nYes, but it would be a bit complicated and have to also be done to some existing methods.\r\n\r\nWe would have to build that yielding signature in to `patch`, `Formula.brew`, `Resource.stage`, and maybe a couple other things, because not every point that wants to call `mktemp_preserve` is directly calling `mktemp`. For example, here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    formula.brew do\r\n      FileUtils.mktemp_preserve if ARGV.keep_tmp?\r\n      formula.patch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a few intermediate calls between that `formula.brew` and what eventually passes the block along to `mktemp`. They'd all have to change their signatures, and I thought committing to that would be a bigger change in both implementation and internal API. The current approach also lets you structure things so you can do the `mktemp_preserve` call inside functions called from that block, or even in functions which may or may not be running inside a `mktemp` call.\r\n\r\nDoing it with the block argument does fix the locality/multithreading issues, and it looks like more idiomatic Ruby. Maybe it's worth it. My sense says no, because the change would hit so many commonly used things in existing code. But maybe it is: passing the mktemp context to those blocks would be a more appropriate mechanism for associating the block with the temporary space it's running in.\r\n\r\nOpen to opinions here from people with more Ruby/`brew` experience.",

It requires threading another parameter through all the `stage do` and `mktemp do` and `brew do` calls.

This probably needs to be done with a cmake wrapper like the cc wrapper that modifies the command line arguments, using -D to set the CMAKE_* variables. Unlike CMAKE_*_PATH (without SYSTEM), environment variables with those names don't seem to be supported by CMake.\r\n\r\nI think in CMake's case this would be something they'd be willing to take a patch for (if one is necessary; it may be possible to just do this at either compilation or runtime).\r\n\r\n> Maybe we should switch from CMAKE_*_PATH to CMAKE_SYSTEM_*_PATH entirely in our cmake environment setup. The non-SYSTEM CMAKE_*_PATH variables are high-precedence, coming before both PATHS and HINTS that are computed inside the build script. This could have unexpected effects on build scripts that are not expecting that customization or have sloppy detection implementations.\r\n\r\nThis may work :+1: ",

But `false` is a command, and it causes this behavior. If this is intentional, might be worth putting an explanatory comment where it's being set.\r\n\r\nFrom my reading of the `git` doco, this isn't version-dependent. I think we'll need to set something else if you want to avoid printing out this warning. I don't know what it is, but maybe something related to `credential.helper` instead of askpass-specific stuff. I suspect a lot of `brew` users (including myself) won't see this because they're using the `osxkeychain` credential helper instead of the `askpass` one.\r\n\r\nBut I think having a warning here, or at least some \"skipped updating non-accessible tap repo foocorp/foo\" progress message, is a good thing.

We'll fix a few trivial style issues that were reintroduced since the last big style fixup, but until we can run `brew style` on the test bot, they will creep back in. I just ran `brew style Library/Homebrew` and it finished with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n261 files inspected, 692 offenses detected\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile some of those offenses are automatically fixable, I suspect most of them require manual intervention, i.e. someone needs to look at the code and either (1) follow the advice, (2) tweak the default RuboCop style by disabling/adjusting a rule globally, or (3) disable the cop locally in the problematic line.\r\n\r\nHere's a suggestion (best implemented *after* #112 is merged):\r\n\r\n- Blacklist all files that currently have code style issues, meaning they will be reported by `brew style`, but they won't cause it to have a non-zero return value, unlike files not on that list.\r\n- Enable `brew style` on the test bot.\r\n- In a timely manner, go through the list of blacklisted files, fix the code style issues, and remove the cleaned-up files from the list. (One by one or in batches of several files, depending on how difficult it is to resolve the style issues.)\r\n\r\nThe big advantage would be that we wouldn't have to do all style fixes at once and we would avoid re-introducing style issues into files that have already been cleaned up.",

For example, if I type `brew info az<tab>`, it will almost immediately be completed to `brew info azure-cli` (because there's only one formula name starting with `az`).

		"body" : "Maybe you're running in to a pathological case related to locales here. Using `\"C\"` as your locale is probably wrong, especially if you're mixing it with Unicode/UTF-8 and international characters. (\"C\" is an alias for \"POSIX\", which mostly treats all characters as single-byte opaque characters, but speaking strictly has undefined behavior for some character values; maybe that's interacting weirdly with the `\"UTF-8\"` LC_CTYPE.) If you're running with a \"C\" locale, some things will break. (Even if a forum post or StackOverflow answer told you to do so.) And strictly speaking, `\"UTF-8\"` is not a valid locale value at all.\r\n\r\nSince nothing else panned out, let's address these strange locale settings and see if that fixes things.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, OS X and its Terminal.app will not set your locale variables to `\"C\"`, they'll use region-specific UTF-8 locale settings, like `\"en_US.UTF-8\"`. So it may be your shell setup that's setting these variables. Check your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, and `~/.profile`, and other shell startup files to see if they're setting locale variables. (Just `grep 'LC_\\|LANG' ~/.*` and see what pops up. I know you posted `.bashrc` earlier, but maybe there are other shell config files hanging around?)\r\n\r\nBetween that and loading the old `brew` bash completions, looks like there are some machine configuration issues here.",

I'd find it weird and hard to understand if `--include-optional` only applied to the immediate dependencies. And if we added a new option like `--include-optional-for=<formula1>,<formula2>,‚Ä¶`, our already hard to grasp `brew deps` with all its options would become even more complicated.

For more complicated cases like the one you sketched, a human would need to look at the dependency tree (or graph), thus I'd suggest to improve `deps --tree` for this. It's functionality is currently very limited, but it shouldn't be too difficult to make it output a tree where build, optional, recommended, and hard dependencies are all printed together, but are still distinguishable. This form of visualization is also much better suited for adding something like `--max-levels=<n>` where the tree would be truncated at depth `<n>`, but leaves that haven't been fully expanded could be annotated as such.",

I think part of the problem with deps is that it's not really designed to answer that context specific question. Sure it can be, if you sit there and reason through the tree and pick the right command line switches, and consult a graph theory text book, and meditate for a while, and then intersect that with your Cellar being careful to track what's already satisifed, etc. etc., but it's a silly enterprise if brew install already knows the exact answer to the context specific question without any other fuss.",

Topological order would only matter if the dependency tree was fully expanded, which it is not. I think the confusion stems from the fact that `brew deps --installed` has two different meanings, depending on whether formulae are supplied to the command or not:\r\n\r\n- `brew deps --installed` simply lists all installed formulae and their immediate dependencies (the output you saw). It respects the `--include-*` and `--skip-*` options, but all other options are ignored. It does support the `--tree` option, but I'd say the usefulness of that is limited.\r\n\r\n- `brew deps [--installed] <formula>` expands the complete dependency tree of `<formula>` (or trees, if multiple formulae are given). Aside from the `--include-*` and `--skip-*` options it also respects the `--1`, `-n` (topological order), and `--union` options. The effect of `--installed` in this case is to intersect the computed dependency list with the list of installed formulae. Maybe two examples can help illustrate this:\r\n  - `brew deps gtk+` lists all dependencies of `gtk+`.\r\n  - `brew deps --installed gtk+` lists all already installed dependencies of `gtk+`.\r\n  - The difference between these outputs is roughly the list of dependencies that would be installed in addition to what is already on my system if I decided to run `brew install gtk+`.\r\n\r\nDoes this help? I'd say this is primarily a documentation issue. I'd be more than happy if you created a pull request that improves our documentation.

And we can't easily change the defaults as that would break other users' scripts that rely on the current output/behavior.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially introduce a `--no-1` option to invert the behavior, but I'm not convinced yet that we need a mode where every installed formula is listed with *all* its dependencies.

And to become (and remain) the dominant package manager on a platform, Homebrew needs to have the complete trust of its users.\r\n\r\nWith the current climate of privacy-hostile applications, platforms, operating systems and governments, default-on telemetry gathering of any sort isn't really acceptable.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I completely understand the drive to gather metrics. After all, they help us make our products better. They help us figure out more easily what users need. However I don't think it's unreasonable to be pushing a privacy-first ethos in our industry.\r\n\r\nMetrics are valuable, but not at the expense of user trust.

Opt-in doesn't mean a silent default-off and an expectation that the user will dig around to find out how to enable analytics. Opt-in could mean a prompt on install (or first interactive run for existing users), with \"no\" selected by default, as per Debian's Popcon.\r\n\r\nI do agree with the reservations people have with Google Analytics. As valuable as it is, Google do have a unique position where they could very easily correlate analytics events across app/device boundaries (using IP addresses, for instance). This means users have to put a lot of trust in Google that they'll obey their own privacy settings.\r\n\r\n@ntpd has it right. Popcon does the analytics thing in the most respectful (default-off) and informative way. For the most part, I don't object to popcon on personal machines (restrictions in varies enterprise environments are different). Popcon's hosted by Debian themselves, and the data is public.

Since then Mike has made it very clear and final, so I'll make one final comment as a courtesy to people who replied to me, and unsubscribe from this issue.\r\n\r\n@ntpd \r\n\r\n> I'd like to see some examples of it being used in this way\r\n\r\n[I do](https://github.com/zmwangx/dotfiles/blob/master/provision). Since I don't use other people's bootstrapping scripts, I can't seem to give a good example right now where Homebrew is installed non-interactively, but the git-cloning is definitely an important channel of installation ‚Äî many of us don't like curl pipe into interpreter, let alone giving it root privilege. If you just want an example of Homebrew installation as part of a bootstrapping process, [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop\r\n) is one (I just took a closer look and although they set up /usr/local for Homebrew manually, they still run the installation script interactively, which is rather weird ‚Äî they could very well just install via git).\r\n\r\n>  but the simple solution is that the brew installation can use a --nointeraction parameter which defaults analytics to the safe option of False when a user is not able to consent.\r\n\r\nFYI, you don't need an option. Just run the install script with stdin redirected to `/dev/null`, and it will skip all the interactive prompts. Still, analytics should be opt-out. The decision has been anyway.\r\n\r\n@davb5 \r\n\r\n> Many people here object to default-on analytics. Let's respect that and leave metric collection off by default.\r\n\r\nMany people? I see 115 people upvoting this issue, and even upvoting doesn't mean they object to default-on analytics. It could mean they didn't like how the rollout process was executed, and honestly it could have been better, but (1) it happened; (2) it has already been improved. What do you expect more?\r\n\r\nInternet forums have a magnifying effect where a few users complaining (especially passionate ones leaving many comments) could feel like \"many people\".\r\n\r\n@NickCraver \r\n\r\n> This is not correct. There are proxies, blockers, anonymizers, and even Tor. All remote analytics are easily avoided and to some degree inherently are in large environments due to so many users coming from a single source.\r\n\r\nSure. But how is calling home with an anonymous UUID any different? What's the harm when your UUID behind your anonymized IP can't be matched to you as an individual? Also, server logs can't be erased on your part, but calling home with analytics can be disabled.\r\n\r\n@lacombar \r\n\r\n> you can't avoid NSA spying either, though it doesn't make it right.\r\n\r\nThis is such a straw man argument on every single level, it's impossible to reply.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAgain, this will be my last comment, so even if you come back at me, you won't hear anything from me again on this thread.

It's feasible for us to code things so that we have one ID per Homebrew installation. It's probably unrealistic to think that we'll be able to set things up so that it corresponds closer to human users: most users with multiple machines will probably not share these config/data files between their machines, won't (and shouldn't) go out of their way to do so, and trying to do so opens us up to more edge case behavior. So it'll behave closer to an installation ID anyway.

In a long-term effort we could also start using this location for other Homebrew-specific configuration data, that is currently exclusively contained in `HOMEBREW_*` environment variables.

Currently one necessary condition for analytics is `homebrew.analyticsmessage` in the git config file being set to `true`, which won't happen until one has run `brew update` at least once, which should initialize the git repository, so the worst case scenario is a bunch of error messages from git-config. We can append `2>/dev/null` to git-config calls if that's preferred.\r\n\r\n> My suggestion would be to start using etc/homebrew/ in the Homebrew prefix and put the UUID file in that directory.\r\n\r\nThis might be a good idea. Since git-config `homebrew.analyticsmessage` and `homebrew.analyticsdisabled` are already shipped on the master branch, I'd prefer to stick to git-config at this point. A separate config file/directory could be another discussion (and definitely an interesting one).",

One of the environment variables being set is `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and one of the paths contained in this variable is `/Applications/MATLAB_R2013a.app/bin/maci64`. This directory contains an older version of `libmpfr.1.dylib`. Because `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` takes precedence above the paths recorded inside a binary like `cc1plus`, it tries to load the library that is part of MATLAB (because it has the same file name) instead of the one installed by Homebrew. You can check the contents of that environment variable from within MATLAB:\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\ngetenv('DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's an issue specific to MATLAB and unfortunately there's nothing Homebrew can do about this. I'd strongly suggest to use Clang (as that's the only officially supported compiler by MathWorks on OS X). If that's not possible, because you need OpenMP and/or FORTRAN support, you can try building outside of MATLAB or you can try resetting `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` from withing MATLAB by running\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\nsetenv('DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH', '')\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore trying to use `gcc45`.

I'm not a big fan of the currently proposed constant (module, class) aliasing and neither seems Ruby 1.8. Singletons and inheritance could work, but doesn't sound like typical Ruby code, even though it's probably more friendly for testing.\r\n\r\nHere's what I think is idiomatic, relatively clean, and requires comparatively few changes (example):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# In 'hardware.rb':\r\nmodule Hardware\r\n  module CPU # Called GenericCPU in current proposal.\r\n    # Platform-agnostic parts of the implementation.\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"os/hardware\"\r\n\r\n# In 'os/hardware.rb':\r\nif OS.mac?\r\n  require \"os/mac/hardware\"\r\n  Hardware::CPU.extend(OS::Mac::Hardware::CPU)\r\nelsif OS.linux?\r\n  require \"os/linux/hardware\"\r\n  Hardware::CPU.extend(OS::Linux::Hardware::CPU)\r\nend\r\n\r\n# In 'os/mac/hardware.rb':\r\nmodule OS\r\n  module Mac\r\n    module Hardware\r\n      module CPU\r\n        # Mac-specific pieces of the implementation.\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# In 'os/linux/hardware.rb':\r\nmodule OS\r\n  module Linux\r\n    module Hardware\r\n      module CPU\r\n        # Linux-specific pieces of the implementation.\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same pattern could also be applied in all other cases where things need to be separated.

And we need to keep some state as, e.g., `fuser` alone won't tell us why a file is being accessed (is that a `brew update` running or something else). To stay with the `fuser` example, it's also horribly slow on my system (around 5 s to completion) and spawns an entirely new `perl` process.

The existing practice of putting double quotes around the raw value breaks for values containing `\"`, `$`, `` ` ... ` ``, `$( ... )` (and possibly more) in sh-derived shells and for values containing `\"`, `$`, `!`, `` ` ... ` `` or a literal newline in tcsh.\r\n\r\nI'm also overloading `--shell` so that with an an explicit empty value `--shell=`, it prints in the `key: value` and doesn't quote anything.

The error message from one of the failed bottle runs is complaining about an extant lock file in the `homebrew/versions` tap inside its workspace.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit reset --hard origin/master\r\nHEAD is now at 96bff5b gnupg21: add 2.1.12 bottle.\r\nbrew update\r\nerror: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': Unable to create '/Users/brew/Jenkins/jobs/Homebrew Bottles/workspace/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-versions/.git/refs/remotes/origin/master.lock': File exists.\r\n\r\nIf no other git process is currently running, this probably means a\r\ngit process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git\r\nprocess is running and remove the file manually to continue.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of the others just complain about remote ref SHA mismatches.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit checkout -f master\r\nAlready on 'master'\r\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.\r\n  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\r\ngit reset --hard origin/master\r\nHEAD is now at a6b99a5 civl: remove cvc4 dependency\r\nbrew update\r\nerror: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': ref refs/remotes/origin/master is at f08e21a7961085ca4452b778c0b56e8f4982a144 but expected a6b99a561cf09867c7613a6fdc937b53cc72ba65\r\nerror: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': ref refs/remotes/origin/master is at f08e21a7961085ca4452b778c0b56e8f4982a144 but expected a6b99a561cf09867c7613a6fdc937b53cc72ba65\r\nerror: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': ref refs/remotes/origin/master is at f08e21a7961085ca4452b778c0b56e8f4982a144 but expected a6b99a561cf09867c7613a6fdc937b53cc72ba65\r\nerror: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': ref refs/remotes/origin/master is at f08e21a7961085ca4452b778c0b56e8f4982a144 but expected a6b99a561cf09867c7613a6fdc937b53cc72ba65\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a brew update operation that seems to be interacting with some job's git operations.\r\n\r\nHere's another thing. most of the projects seem to have their own workspaces. But Versions and Core do not. Could their workspaces be aliased to `/usr/local`, so that their local in-workspace git operations are acting on the same repo that Bottle's `brew update` is acting on?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrobotunicorn:jobs brew$ pwd\r\n/Users/brew/Jenkins/jobs\r\nrobotunicorn:jobs brew$ ls -ld */workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Nov 27  2014 Homebrew Apache Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 30  2014 Homebrew Binary Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 14 brew  staff  476 May  6 21:46 Homebrew Bottles/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 25  2014 Homebrew Completions Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Dec 30  2014 Homebrew Devel-Only Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 23  2014 Homebrew Dupes Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 23  2014 Homebrew Games Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 30  2014 Homebrew Head-Only Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Nov  4  2014 Homebrew Nginx Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 30  2014 Homebrew PHP Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 30  2014 Homebrew Python Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Oct 23  2014 Homebrew Science Pull Requests/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Feb  8  2014 Homebrew Testing/workspace\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 brew  staff   68 Nov  6  2014 Homebrew X11 Pull Requests/workspace\r\nrobotunicorn:jobs brew$\r\n```",

A lot of contributions to Homebrew are _\"Hey this is popular, I found it, played with it a bit and it seems cool, maybe others want to use it too\"_ - I'd say we get considerably more contributions like that than we do people who know the tool intimately. I'm reluctant to further stigmatise simple tests when we explicitly say simple is better than nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a heavy-handed use of DSL modification & a one-size-fits-all kind of change, where contributors are \"taught\" `version` or `help` are \"bad\" when sometimes (A bunch of GUI or X11 stuff comes to mind immediately) \"bad\" is as good as we're going to every get, short of being able to fake interactivity.\r\n",

A more useful thing than adding complex tests to all formulae would be trying to add regression tests to formulae that have had packaging issues to make sure we don't provide broken versions in future.

Just think about formulae implemented in an interpreted language like Python, where most modules won't even be loaded if only the version is queried. The same applies for compiled programs that have a plugin structure. A test that uses some of the actual functionality of a formula won't (and shouldn't) ever replace an upstream test suite, but will give us much more realistic coverage than a simple `--version`.\r\n\r\n> A more useful thing than adding complex tests to all formulae would be trying to add regression tests to formulae that have had packaging issues to make sure we don't provide broken versions in future.\r\n\r\nSorry to be this frank, but my feeling is that you're derailing the discussion here. I agree this is a useful thing to have, but that's completely orthogonal to what is being proposed here.\r\n\r\n> As a result I'd rather avoid a DSL element that can already be revealed by `grep`, would require large amounts of manual work on existing formulae to flag them [‚Ä¶]\r\n\r\nWhat's the issue with making this `grep`pable? I don't see a good alternative to making this part of the DSL *if* we want to be able to query information about a formula's test (beyond whether it exists or not) from code. But maybe I'm overlooking something. Like with many other changes, I don't see why we wouldn't be able to introduce this incrementally in the course of updating formulae. To facilitate this, the default tag could be `:unclassified` while `:trivial` and `:nontrivial` would be used explicitly. We're in no hurry to update existing tests of formulae that haven't been touched for a long time.\r\n\r\n> [‚Ä¶] and honestly doesn't seem to solve any end-user problems.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't understand this statement. A non-negligible problem of our users is that the software we package ends up being broken. Tests help to ensure it is working properly (which depends on it being installed correctly). Exercising some functionality of the software in the test makes us more confident about that. After all, most users care about the functionality some software provides, not whether `<program> --version` works.\r\n\r\n> Using the DSL for documentation purposes seems like an abuse unless it's actually functionally doing something to change behavior.\r\n\r\n@ilovezfs I don't agree. A formula's `desc` is also mostly useless and doesn't affect functionality of `brew` at all unless you start searching for a description. The same can be said of the proposed test tagging. In its current form, it is exposed via `Formula#test_trivial?` and could be immediately used in a code snippet like below. (Fleshing this out a bit more and making it a `dev-cmd` would be easy, but premature and possibly a waste of time‚Äîjudging by the currently dominant stance towards this PR.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew for-each-formula 'puts f.full_name if f.test_trivial?'\r\n```",

(It's easy to forget to re-run `brew man` as you've already learned.) I fixed this now. If you update your Homebrew via `brew update`, check out your `gist-logs-help` branch, and run `git rebase master` (this should complete without any conflicts), then your changes will be based off the latest commit to `master` and those spurious changes will be gone. (You should do this before adding the above mentioned changes.)\r\n\r\nIf you feel comfortable using `git rebase --interactive`, consider squashing your branch to a single commit and then pushing that, when you are done. Don't worry if you aren't. I can also do that for you when integrating your changes into Homebrew. No matter if you squashed your commits or not, you should be able to see the changes that will end up in this PR once you push if you run `git diff master...gist-logs-help` locally.\r\n\r\n> I changed the wording in that file from \"several different ways\" to \"in several different ways\", as that was the origination point for my copying the wording to Specifying Formulae, so I wanted to fix the same wording issue in both places I knew it existed.\r\n\r\nThat's fine.

		"body" : "TL;DR: What exactly do you want to accomplish here by leaving `$JAVA_HOME` undefined? I'll bet you can accomplish that through other means. Or if you can't, we can provide a purpose-designed hook for it. `brew` probably really does want to make sure that `$JAVA_HOME` is defined and controlled by `brew`, as part of setting up a uniform build environment.\r\n\r\nDetails follow:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHomebrew takes responsibility for locating all the needed compilers and runtimes for software builds. it accepts user input, but doesn't just pass through the user's environment for build tools to use to do their own location logic. We try to reduce variance and impose control, and minimize sensitivity to user configuration.\r\n\r\nIt identifies and selects the JDK it's going to use for building, and setting `$JAVA_HOME` \r\n\r\n> because if JAVA_HOME isn't set, then won't Java-based commands just use the default anyway?\r\n\r\nThis begs the question of \"what is the default, and how is it chosen?\". And there's a lot of variance between Java packages' build processes, because Java never standardized any platform-specific deployment processes. (Much to its and our detriment, but it is what it is.)\r\n\r\nAs an experienced Java developer, I think Homebrew almost certainly wants to define and take responsibility for `$JAVA_HOME` within its builds. We can (and IMHO probably should) [respect user-supplied `$JAVA_HOME`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/183) for location of JDK installations. But leaving `$JAVA_HOME` undefined and allowing Java packages to do their own JDK detection is a recipe for unending pain, for Homebrew users and maintainers both.\r\n\r\nHomebrew definitely should not be sensitive to a user-specific `~/.mavenrc`. I would also argue that it should not be sensitive to a machine-specific `/etc/mavenrc`, either. In Maven terms, Homebrew produces globally-relevant build artifacts that are relocatable to all users. `~/.mavenrc` and `/etc/mavenrc` are relevant for developers. If they provide caching and upstream provider configuration, we should respect that, but that's mostly for performance. Anything that changes the actual outcome of a build is something Homebrew would want to filter out. This is analagous to changing the location of the upstream `homebrew/brew` repo and bottle domain: probably useful to some people, but an advanced configuration, and something we should reject hard in the normal use case.\r\n\r\nSo, _all that being said_: yeah, Homebrew's interaction with Maven is a little half-assed. But Homebrew's goal is to minimize user-dependent variability, and to provide standard quasi-system-level builds of stuff. I think `$JAVA_HOME` JDK detection and Maven configuration are largely orthogonal: Maven is mostly concerned about artifact identification and caching, and has a very good system for that. If we can align our sandboxing with the Maven repo caching configuration, that could make our builds faster and smoother. But in general, Maven configuration that alters the outcome of a build, as opposed to how you fetch centrally-tracked artifacts, is non-brewy.",

Even though we don't use it for anything now AFAIK, it seems like a legit usage to explicitly set something to an empty string. For example, in Makefiles, you might want `DESTDIR` or a program name prefix to be the empty string, which would correspond to a command line option like `--destdir=` or `--destdir=\"\"` or `--program-prefix=''`. Allowing syntax for explicitly setting something to an empty string can make option processing code simpler, especially when you're generating argument lists to be passed to another program; otherwise the caller has to both be aware of the callee's default behavior and deliberately remove arguments to get the default value, instead of just setting everything from a key/value set.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: That whole last paragraph was irrelevant because I misread what \"arg\" was referring to in the original PR. Disregard.\r\n\r\nInstead of just disallowing `-` and `=`, maybe it would make more sense to positively construct the pattern for valid option names, (e.g. `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`) and disallow everything that doesn't match it. The new logic still allows for spaces, special characters, and wacky unicode stuff, like `--‚òÉ=frosty`.",

The use of `arg` as a variable name and term in prose here threw me off a bit, because it doesn't align with what seems to be conventional use for it. In command line parsing, the whole `--foo=bar` token is a command line \"argument\", and when it's interpreted as an option, then `foo` or `--foo` is the \"option name\", and `bar` is the \"option value\" or \"option argument\" aka \"optarg\". But here we're using \"arg\" to refer to the `foo` part (I think). I haven't seen anything else call that part an \"argument\". A `def value(name)` or `def value(option_name)` might make more sense.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I just realized that I made this mistake while reading this PR: when you said \"Don't allow for ... an empty `<arg>`\", I misread that as meaning the `bar` value part.

What I meant to prevent by this was funky stuff like `---option=` (notice the third dash), but right now it would also prevent legitimate cases like `--program-prefix=`.\r\n\r\n> And why disallow empty strings as the argument value?\r\n\r\nI realize you noticed this already, but just to be super clear: The intention is to prevent `--=value`; `--name=` is of course perfectly valid and desirable. (In fact one of the aims of this change is to allow for `--name=`, i.e. `ARGV.value(\"name\")` should return an empty string but currently returns `nil`.)\r\n\r\n> Instead of just disallowing `-` and `=`, maybe it would make more sense to positively construct the pattern for valid option names, (e.g. `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`) and disallow everything that doesn't match it. The new logic still allows for spaces, special characters, and wacky unicode stuff, like `--‚òÉ=frosty`.\r\n\r\nThat's an excellent suggestion. I like the Unicode stuff, but I guess there's no need to support it in option names (a sane subset of ASCII is more reasonable).\r\n\r\n> May be a good opportunity for a reword, too.

I think I see what you mean, but it seems that cannot keep happening if I keep repeating `link/unlink` as in #239.\r\nJust to make sure I get it: For each conflict, `brew link foo` will replace a symlink to a directory pertaining to another formula to symlinks to individual files; `brew unlink foo` will not remove symlinks for other formulas, and it will not \"merge\" the symlinks to a directory back into one to a folder, so we arrive at a slightly different situation (which is fine).\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that repeating immediately `brew link foo`/`brew unlink foo` will not find again the same conflicts, so there the counts should match. And that's good: otherwise, just repeated linking and unlinking (certainly an odd operation) would \"leak\" inodes. That's why I opened #239.\r\n\r\nAnyway:  I'm satisfied with the result after this PR.",

Or closing this and opening a new PR to do so might be less work than revising this and editing the description and comment history on this one to still be cogent.\r\n\r\nAt this location, I'd do something simpler like \"`brew search --desc <keyword>`\"; don't worry too much about the full syntax with `|` and such, since this is a brief, informal message.\r\n\r\n> In addition I can create a separate PR to add --desc to the help text for brew search\r\n\r\n:+1: You could just include it in the same PR, since it's related. It would be nice to have this too, since `--desc` is intended for common use by end users, so `brew --help` should describe it.\r\n\r\n...and while you're in there, this is what the current `brew --help search` says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew search, -S:\r\n    Display all locally available formulae for brewing (including tapped ones).\r\n    No online search is performed if called without arguments.\r\n\r\nbrew search, -S text|/text/:\r\n    Perform a substring search of formula names for text. If text is\r\n    surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression.\r\n    The search for text is extended online to some popular taps.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI dunno about you, but that \"`brew search, -S`\" format with the comma seems odd and hard to read to me, and isn't standard quasi-BNF syntax. And using \"text\" as the placeholder for both literal text and regex patterns is hard to read IMHO. Maybe it should be something more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew (search | -S)\r\n   ...\r\nbrew (search | -S) (text | /pattern/)\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr just drop the `-S` from the helptext entirely, since it makes the syntax description more complex, and I'll bet 80%+ of users are using the `search` form instead of `-S`. If nothing else, change all the helptext to say `brew search ...` and then just put a footnote at the bottom saying \"`-S` may be used as a synonym for `search`\". Something like this, with appropriate markup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew search\r\n   ...\r\nbrew search (text | /pattern/)\r\n   ...\r\n\r\nThe `-S` switch may be used as a synonym for the `search` subcommand.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"body" : "Geoff,\r\n\r\nI won't speak on behalf of other maintainers, but I can and will speak to my own concerns & experiences.\r\n\r\nI'll also note the following for transparency's sake:\r\n* In the last 3 months I have erased the contents of one Issue, because it contained purely personal abuse to the Homebrew maintainers on really quite a nasty level.\r\n* Over my time in Homebrew 4 people have been blocked organisation-wide by me:\r\n  * One for persistent GitHub insults to maintainers, and then finding maintainer's personal Twitter accounts and tweeting personal abuse to each of us repeatedly, over a persistent period of a couple of days.\r\n  * One for sending abusive emails to maintainers' personal email accounts after doing so repeatedly on GitHub and being asked to stop.\r\n  * One for posting repeated personal abuse on various GitHub issues, including to normal contributors, and refusing to stop when asked. That block was removed after a week, and then re-implemented when that person went right back to abusing contributors.\r\n  * One for creating a new account that had been blocked previously to continue abusing the maintainers.\r\n\r\nI'll also note that fundamentally, whilst the Code of Conduct is absolutely applied equally, white men have a severe imbalance in influence over open source and the voices and experiences of women and non-white contributors are frequently trampled over by FOSS communities. Homebrew is determined to not become one of those communities.\r\n\r\nYou have free speech to call me a prick, insist I should quit FOSS, suggest I should jump off a bridge, etc, and I'll note those aren't _theoretical examples_ of things that have been emailed, tweeted or posted on GitHub at me personally during my time maintaining Homebrew.\r\n\r\nYou have the free speech to say those things to me, but I have the free speech to say we don't welcome those comments around Homebrew and we won't endure them. Your free speech does not === the right to abuse me. That's not what free speech is, not even in law for many legal systems; most have \"harm exemptions\" to the free speech mechanism.\r\n\r\nJust as your local pub can throw you out to stop you yelling at the guy sat next to you that you think he's a waste of oxygen and looks like Shrek, Homebrew can do the same thing. This is why Code of Conduct's exist, to enforce a _minimum_ conduct. Not to make sure every comment is one of grovelling approval but to make sure it doesn't degrade into outright insults and personal attacks.\r\n\r\nYour local pub tossing you out because you won't stop yelling insults at that poor guy is by the strictest definition censorship, but degrees of censorship are everywhere in life _(Twitter will suspend your account if you do nothing but tweet racist abuse @ people, for example)_. Yelling censorship like its a one-size-fits-all problem is disingenuous, and I apply that broadly over the last couple of weeks more than I apply it to your comment, I add.\r\n\r\nI will note that if people have constructive suggestions to make about analytics that go beyond _\"you are all terrible human beings and this is something the NSA would do\"_ your Issue will remain open until we can resolve it one way or another. As a shining example [this issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/152) was opened on a productive subject Homebrew could work with, and has remained open for 18 days without significant issue.\r\n\r\nCome to us with _\"Oh you could improve the opt-out mechanism with this tweak\"_ or _\"Have you considered this analytics provider instead?\"_ or anything like that and the issue is not only welcome but encouraged. If you come to us with _\"You're all a disgrace to open source, spies for Google and have been paid off by the government to collect this data\"_ and again, those aren't _theoretical examples_, that's an Issue that clearly isn't going anywhere and harm reduction comes into play.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the \"humblebrag\" I contributed _the most_ commits to the Homebrew organisation last year, let alone the amount of Issues and Pull Requests I review. Contribution buys you _trust_, it doesn't necessarily buy you the right to make others feel absolutely awful, and look, I have fairly crappy health, I've written about that publicly before now _(and removed the posts 6 months later worrying about them)_, but none of this has been good for my health and I _have a lot of fondness_ for working on Homebrew.\r\n\r\nImagine being someone who doesn't know Homebrew, or someone who is vulnerable or from a section of society whose voices are respected less than us white men, and going to file an Issue with Homebrew, but before you do you check the Issue below and discover someone calling the maintainers every name under the sun and comparing them to their favourite government spy agency. Would that make _you_ want to contribute to Homebrew or would it make you want to run in the opposite direction as fast as you could? This isn't a theoretical problem. Look at tech's ongoing diversity problem, that is amplified _significantly_ in FOSS.\r\n\r\nTo be blunt, if you feel threatened by us trying to make Homebrew a safer space for everyone, from all walks of life, and the people who feel threatened feel a bit safer, I'll take that trade off because the difference between their real threat level and your's is almost universally huge, just huge.\r\n\r\nAnd don't take that as me wanting you to feel like you aren't welcome here, because you _absolutely are_ and I appreciate your contributions and the discussions we've had this week _alone_, but we're both privileged to be white men and that discussion has a place in free speech and its consequences.\r\n\r\nI am permanently uneasy with the erasure of comments, but I will not discard the harm inflicted by those comments in terms of both maintainer health and also with the view that Homebrew and FOSS would not be a worse place if people who weren't white men felt more comfortable contributing on a regular basis. There is a balance here, but the balance isn't to allow people to say and do unto others whatever they desire without consequence.",

		"body" : "Hi @geoff-codes,\r\n\r\nFirstly, our bug tracker is not an area for public expression; it's a place for reporting actionable bugs or issues we have previously not closed as a WONTFIX. People who want to express themselves publicly have Twitter, blogs and any number of other places on the internet for doing that (but @DomT4 has already made the point on this better than I have).\r\n\r\nSecondly, you're one of the first (maybe the only) person who has created an issue about this who has actually contributed meaningfully to Homebrew. Most people who have \"expressed concerns\" have not been part of this community and have been publicly or privately abusive (particularly to me and @DomT4). I don't want to bore you by digging up the number or content of the private abusive emails I've been getting over the last few weeks but I'm beyond bored of them now. I edit content because I regularly have to click through issues and I don't want to read abuse repeated to me again and again.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the priority for me when running Homebrew is the sanity of the maintainers who contribute the most to Homebrew. As @DomT4 mentioned, between him and I we're two of the most active maintainers on this project and there's a bunch of stuff in the sidelines (applying for GSoC, keeping CI servers running, managing our finances, apply for SFC) that may not happen if the two of us dropped off. This whole analytics situation has had me very tempted on more than one occasion to leave open-source altogether and (without being too arrogant here): that would be bad for this project. If Homebrew has no more maintainers the project will die.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm happy to work to address concerns beyond \"no analytics!\" and \"analytics should be opt-out\" for reasons I've explained at extreme length in multiple other places. Whenever these concerns have been raised I've made PRs to fix them usually merged within 24 hours.",

The problem is that we'll be blamed that we broke people's builds and we just don't have the man power to fix all those breakages ourselves or to pester upstream to do it, with some upstreams understandably not being too interested in OS X. Things were a lot easier, if we could properly test these changes in a separate branch in the background and only deploy this once we are confident that most build failures are fixed or worked around. But this would require more CI than we currently have and ideally a set of VMs where the configurations are items of the Cartesian product of {10.9, 10.10, 10.11} with {CLT-only, Xcode-only, CLT-and-Xcode} ‚Ä¶\r\n\r\n> One piece of low-hanging fruit that might help is to have a way to require the CLT.\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n> Me neither, but I wonder if the AC_CHECK_LIB code itself could be improved to detect the linkage failure even when clang exits 0 (perhaps by also confirming the linked paths actually exist!).\r\n\r\nThis could help dealing with what I believe to be an Apple bug (see below).

In this specific example, `libnetwork.tbd` should have been tagged with a minimum OS X release of 10.11 and the linker should fail the link when the deployment target is set to 10.10.\r\n\r\nThat's not the only problem with these `.tbd` files. I have also seen a case where the library referenced by the `.tbd` file existed on both 10.10 and 10.11, but the list of symbols included symbols that were not available in the 10.10 version of that library. In that case, the link also succeeded though it should have failed. (But Apple apparently didn't think about attaching version information to symbols.)",

We do `VCSDownloadStrategy#fetch` in `build.rb`, it goes OK, `formula.prefix.mkpath` inside `Build#install` works just fine and creates proper directory, but `Formula` inside `FormulaInstaller` still has nil `@commit` in its version, so when we check for empty install we check if `HEAD` directory exists and is not empty, however we have our install in `HEAD-<commit>` directory.\r\n\r\nI found the following workaround here:\r\nBe able to store `@downloader` inside of `HeadVersion`, so we can make `HeadVersion#commit` return `@downloader.last_commit` unless `@downloader` is `nil`.\r\nHeadVersion is firstly initialized in `DSL`:\r\n```ruby\r\n    def head(val = nil, specs = {}, &block)\r\n      @head ||= HeadSoftwareSpec.new\r\n      if block_given?\r\n        @head.instance_eval(&block)\r\n      elsif val\r\n        @head.url(val, specs)\r\n      else\r\n        @head\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can try to initialize `downloader` of `HeadVersion` after `url` is set or better do it after `owner` is set for the `resource` of the `HeadSoftwareSpec`. To initialize downloader we need both `url` and `name` or `owner`. As a result I overrode `Resource#owner=` and `Resource#url=` so they initialize `downloader` for `HeadVersion`.

(I think it's optimistic, but also extremely realistic to assume few characters will leave the ASCII range, so replacing them won't have a noticeable impact on the overall upload size.)\r\n\r\nOn a side note, valid Unicode code points are limited to an upper limit of 1,114,112, thus the maximum number of bytes needed for an UTF-8 encoded code point is only 4 bytes. While surrogates, that really only makes sense with UTF-16, sometimes end up being encoded as UTF-8, they are not valid UTF-8.",

		"body" : "Good point; I had overlooked `post_install`. Thanks. I've amended this PR with an attempt to address this.\r\n\r\n1. Yeah, that probably makes more sense. Keeps related logs closer together, and less chance of the change breaking things that use `Formula.logs`.\r\n\r\nHow about `HOMEBREW_LOGS/Formula/<formula>/{install,post_install,test,...}`? This still keeps all the per-formula logs together, and plain `Formula.logs()` meaningful, but the extra `Formula` level of indirection leaves space for logging other things if needed. It wouldn't be used right away, but since this directory structure reorganization is a potentially breaking change, I'd like to create the ability to add other logging stuff later without requiring an additional breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis naming scheme uses `install`/`post_install`/`test` so the stage names exactly match the method names of the stages in formulae. Though maybe it should be `postinstall` instead, to match the subcommand names instead of the DSL methods.\r\n\r\nI've changed this PR to do this. Under it, `brew build-logs` keeps working without modification. For example, here's `brew build-logs anjuta` after a `brew install -s anjuta`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"802\" alt=\"brew build-logs anjuta under separate build and test log dirs\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/15626192/323a28d2-248c-11e6-832b-6b43b67a812a.png\">\r\n\r\nI think this not only works, but is an improvement, because now the post_install step is broken out in to a separate group. Here's the current `brew build-logs anjuta` for comparison; note the duplication in steps 01 and 02.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" alt=\"brew build-logs current for anjuta\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/15626470/67055b70-2493-11e6-9eb8-ae23fb390c92.png\">\r\n\r\n(The new version happens to be ordered correctly in `build-logs`, too, but that's just an accident of alphabetical ordering. I don't think we can enforce ordering here without introducing another place for potentially breaking changes upon future reorganizations where an additional step is added. Maybe that's worth it, but my first thought is no.)\r\n\r\n2. Handled post_install.\r\n\r\n3. This other way seems more complex to me, because then control of the formula-related log directory structure is distributed throughout the codebase. It'd effectively be using a public mutable property to control the internal behavior of `Formula` code, since it's `Formula.system` that's writing the logs. So someone not familiar with the code and wanting to learn the log structure would have to read the entire code base to determine all the places where the log directory might be set. The way this PR does it now, all the log dir structure code is in one file, `formula.rb`, so you can read that and be confident you get the whole thing. (To the extent that you can do that in a monkey-patchable language like Ruby.)\r\n\r\nThe `Formula` class is getting quite large, but in my view, adding these few methods just linearly adds to that complexity, whereas opening it up for setting log paths and distributing that logic throughout the codebase adds another degree of freedom, and no validity constraints on it, which is a greater increase in overall codebase complexity IMHO.\r\n\r\nIf the size of `Formula` is a concern, maybe we could factor out the logging-related code to a separate `Logs` class. I feel like the excessive size of `Formula` here is a consequence of its existing design, and `Formula` (or a dedicated auxiliary class) is still the right place for this logic.\r\n\r\n####  Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this with `brew install -s anjuta`, since it has a `post_install` step with `system` calls in it, and so do some of its dependencies.\r\n\r\n####  Outstanding TODOs\r\n\r\n* `gist-logs` does not pick up the post_install logs as part of the build logs, but I think it probably should.\r\n* The `sandbox.build.log` should probably be relocated to `install/sandbox.build.log`, and there should probably be support for a `sandbox.postinstall.log`.",

I personally like my current arrangement better, but I think you're probably right here.\r\n\r\n> I think it would be better to leave the build logs \"loose\" in `$HOMEBREW_LOG/formula_name`, and put the test logs in `$HOMEBREW_LOG/formula_name/test`.  (Assuming this still fixes the problem this PR was created to solve.)\r\n\r\nYes, that would solve the problem, I think; it provides the needed separation. (Along with a `HOMEBREW_LOGS/<formula_name>/postinstall`.) And it does seem less prone to break things. Especially because the state after a failed build, which is by far the most common time to use logs (I think), would be the same as the current log handling logic, and this would only change how logs are arranged after a successful build/test.\r\n\r\nI think it also has the advantage of ensuring that the `test` and `postinstall` logs for a formula correspond to the version installed by `brew install` whose logs are there. In my current implementation, if you do `brew install -s foo`, `brew test foo`, and then later `brew upgrade foo`, you could end up with a `test` log from an old version of `foo` and the `install` log from the newer one. Or if installation failed during the main installation, you could have a leftover `postinstall` step from a previous installation. Those seem undesirable.\r\n\r\n>  The fewer levels of navigation necessary, the better.\r\n\r\nHmm. I'd rather get rid of some of the need for manual navigation by introducing a `brew info --log-path` option or similar, so users could write up a little shell alias and jump right to the appropriate logs, instead of having to manually do the `cd ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew` part or know the exact log dir structure. And non-Ruby external scripts could be switched to use it, so they no longer have to embed knowledge of the log directory structure.\r\n\r\nNavigating within these per-formula subdirectories would be convenient, since `postinstall` and `test` would naturally sort after all the numbered files from the build.\r\n\r\n> Also, it wouldn't break anybody's scripts that might depend on build logs being where they currently are.\r\n\r\nIt could still break some things: anything that depends on the current case of every child of the formula log directory being a regular file and a log file could choke once we introduce subdirectories. (E.g. `brew gist-logs`.) But those are probably a minority of scripts, and could be fixed with small tweaks. And anything run after a failed build would have no chance of breakage (unless the failure was specifically in the `postinstall` stage) because the dir layout is unchanged at that point.\r\n\r\nMy gut really likes the tidiness of `HOMEBREW_LOGS/Formula/<name>/{install,postinstall,test}`, but I have to admit that your version is probably better for users (both end users and contributors), and we could always add in the `Formula` indirection later if & when the need actually arises.\r\n\r\nAny other folks see advantages for one way or the other? I haven't tried out the actual code changes yet, but chdiza's way does seem a lot more conservative, and would probably be a non-breaking change for most uses outside the core `brew` code.",

I would have thought that filenames needed to be referenced relative to `Homebrew/test/`, (where the integration tests file lives) but this doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n[There are quite a few details to it](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Kernel.html#method-i-require) and it is further customized by RubyGems, but the gist of it is that it looks at the special Ruby global `$LOAD_PATH` (an array of directories) and tries to resolve the name relative to these directories. The first match is used. (Try `puts $LOAD_PATH` in an interactive `brew irb` session to see its contents.) In a way it's very similar to the shell's search path in the `PATH` environment variable.\r\n\r\nThe main Homebrew search path (`Homebrew/Library/`) is set up in [`brew.rb`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/b9552a5fbf3772b408cdb25c3a545bb1444ba8ff/Library/brew.rb#L5) (`$:` is equivalent to `$LOAD_PATH`). In the test suite `brew.rb` isn't loaded, so this setup happens in [`testing_env.rb`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/b9552a5fbf3772b408cdb25c3a545bb1444ba8ff/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb#L1-2) where both `Library/Homebrew/` and `Library/Homebrew/test/lib/` are prefixed to the search path. The latter has higher precedence and this is what allows the test suite to provide [a custom `config.rb`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/b9552a5fbf3772b408cdb25c3a545bb1444ba8ff/Library/Homebrew/test/lib/config.rb) that is different from [the regular `config.rb`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/b9552a5fbf3772b408cdb25c3a545bb1444ba8ff/Library/Homebrew/config.rb). This is also the explanation for why the test suite can write in various locations without messing up the actual Homebrew installation. Most paths are redirected to a temporary location that only exists for the duration of the test run.\r\n\r\n> I'm a little attached to using `Formula[\"testball\"]` (since it seems \"prettier\") but I'll wait to see if anyone else has a preference. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\r\n\r\nFair. I'm fine with either solution (or a third one I might have not thought of). I don't feel very strongly about this detail, but if it was up to me I'd use the second option. :wink:",

I think the remaining inaccuracy is negligible, as it really only affects legacy systems that don't have Xcode 4.3.x-4.6.x installed, but have the matching Command Line Tools on their systems. Furthermore, it only affects users that have the `cvs` formula installed and the only undesirable (?) effect would be that now our `cvs` is no longer keg-only and thus would take precedence over the one provided by the Command Line Tools. I think this is a sufficiently small attack surface that we should only act on this if prompted by a bug report where this actually creates an issue. Solving the original issue you reported here has a much greater impact and certainly for the good (since we no longer abort with a stack trace).",

I believe `StringIO` will allow for even more flexibility, but is any of its flexibility needed or was it just a tool to achieve the above goals? Will `StringIO` enable additional usage patterns and do you see use cases for them? (Just trying to finally understand the problem and the constraints better.)",

Yes, there are ten lines of \"duplication\" as @UniqMartin has pointed out, but it seems that's outweighed by the fact that the non-dry-run case gets to use the standard function. If, however, it is preferred to just do `formula.path.atomic_write(s) unless ARGV.dry_run?` and thereby avoid the duplication at the cost of not using the \"standard\" function in the non-dry-run case, I'm happy to change to that too, as it's what was already in the PR two iterations ago.\r\n\r\nIdeally, inreplace would natively support this sort of thing, but if that's not immediately obvious to all involved, I'll live with this functionality sitting off in a random helper function in an obscure dev-cmd as long as it gets the job done. :)",

It would be great if you would like to extend this PR to improve it and make it more consistent with the other modes of `brew deps` (if you haven't yet, have a look at `brew help deps`). In my opinion, things worth improving are:\r\n\r\n- Sort items by name. (They are in no particular order as you already noticed.)\r\n\r\n- Add support for the `--include-build`, `--include-optional`, and `--skip-recommended` options, so that it is able to display the same dependencies `brew deps` (without `--tree`) would be displaying. The only difference being that dependencies are shown as a tree instead of a flat list.\r\n\r\n- Annotate tree items so that one can see whether a dependency is a build-time dependency, an optional dependency, a recommended dependency, or a mandatory dependency. (Already noticed and something similar suggested by you.) No need to add an extra option for that, as `brew deps --tree` is only useful for humans and thus does not need to keep a stable/parseable output.\r\n\r\n- Maybe, but this is certainly up for debate, add an option that allows truncating the tree at a certain depth. E.g., `brew deps --tree --depth=2 <formula>` would only show the immediate dependencies of `<formula>` and the immediate dependencies of those first-level dependencies.",

It's only `xcrun` and the various wrappers in `/usr/bin` (like `/usr/bin/git`) that notice that the link is broken and then complain in exactly the way you have observed ‚Ä¶\r\n\r\nI guess the morale of the story, though I haven't looked at the code yet, would be to inspect all our code that relies on `xcode-select` (either directly or indirectly) and to make sure `xcode-select` not only returns a path, but that the returned path actually exists (maybe even check for the presence of a tool like `otool` that is expected to always be there).",

This is one of the reasons we sometimes have to use a source archive tarball temporarily instead of a release tarball. So it would be kind of lame for resource blocks' patch-do blocks to always puke if a patch happens to modify invisible file(s) with the only reason being that we deliberately left those files behind in the cache directory instead of unpacking them with everything else. Though I guess if we applied the patches after unpacking but before installing, it wouldn't matter one way or the other. I'm not sure if that's the ideal time to apply them or not.

So the `brew update` command is using a different version of git than what is used when run from the command prompt manually.  Why is that?\r\n\r\nThe lookup logic is actually quite complicated and does a lot more than just looking in `PATH`:\r\n\r\n1. If `HOMEBREW_GIT` is set in the environment, try that.\r\n2. If `GIT` is set in the environment, try that.\r\n3. If the `git` formula is installed, try that.\r\n4. Iterate over all `git` binaries in `PATH`, but exclude `/usr/bin/git` because it might be a non-functional popup stub if neither Xcode nor Command Line Tools are installed.\r\n5. Try locating a `git` binary using `xcrun -find git`.\r\n6. Try using `git` from Xcode if it is installed in `/Applications/Xcode.app`.\r\n7. Try `/usr/bin/git` if all else failed and we're sure it's not a popup stub.\r\n8. Give up.\r\n\r\nThe first item from that list that matches wins. Now that I've written down the logic, I'm no longer sure this is what should be happening. You might just have helped uncover a bug (or misfeature) in our code. I'll ponder this a bit and check whether we want to improve on that. (In any case, this rundown should help understand why it was picking the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù Git on your machine, probably in step 4.)\r\n\r\n> It might be helpful if the output `brew config` contained the path to git and its version as well as the other tools being used.\r\n\r\nThis is a good suggestion; I agree!

Yes, and tons of tools do this (including your favorite C compiler).\r\n\r\n**But let's make this more productive:** I don't think `brew pull` can learn just from the commit it is pulling that this must be a migration. What it could do is to silence the warning if one of two conditions apply:\r\n\r\n- The commit subject exactly matches `<formula>: migrate from <repository>` and the commit adds a formula file.\r\n- The commit subject exactly matches `<formula>: migrate to <repository>`, the commit removes a formula file, and the commit changes the contents of `tap_migrations.json` (or adds this file).\r\n\r\nIf desired, one could go one step further and add a `--migrate` option (similar to the `--bump` option) so the intention of a migration can be expressed very explicitly. This would then check that one of the two conditions from above is met, auto-correct the commit subject if necessary (just like `--bump`), and fail hard if the commit contents (added/modified/deleted files) don't match expectations.\r\n\r\nI think that's the way forward if the current behavior bothers you sufficiently (I'm getting the impression). And it shouldn't be too difficult to implement with the existing infrastructure in place.",

(AFAIK.) It's not very clear from the code whether this lock dir is per-repo or per-prefix.

True dependencies (not requirements) of type `:run` are really just a way to shut up `brew audit` if stuff like `autoconf` is not tagged with `:build`, i.e. a way to say ‚ÄúI really want this to be a run-time dependency, not just a build-time dependency like in most cases‚Äù. Otherwise there are really only two temporal categories for dependencies:\r\n\r\n- `:build` dependencies: Required only during build. Can (and often will be) removed afterwards.\r\n- All other dependencies: Required both during build (typically for headers, static/dynamic libraries, etc.) and at run time (dynamic libraries, executables, etc.).\r\n  - While it could make sense, Homebrew currently doesn't have a notion of dependencies that don't need to be present during the build phase, but are required at run time. (Examples I can think of is everything with fairly loose coupling, e.g. when it is sufficient that a binary can be executed under a well-known name once the formula is already installed.)\r\n\r\nThus adding `build_dependencies` should be sufficient and together with `dependencies` provides all necessary information to categorize *all* dependencies (as seen from an outsider's perspective).",

With a little bit of Python code you should be able to extract the names of all of the scripts for a particular package using the ``pkg_resources`` library.\r\n\r\n* Also, specific to ``virtualenv`` and not ``venv``, what version of Python you have virtualenv installed with only really matters for what the default is for creating virtual environments. Beyond that you can easily create a virtual environment for different Pythons by using the ``-p`` flag. I think Debian has switched their ``virtualenv`` over to using Python3 but patched it so the default remains 2.x.",

And it won't make a difference if we have a long list of resource blocks, a dump of a frozen requirements.txt used by the code in this PR, or any other language-specific wrapper like install_cabal_package. They are all equally easy or hard to understand (they always require domain-specific knowledge of the package management in the respective language ecosystem). I'm confident that Tim will follow up with documentation for this solution in a timely manner, making it at least as approachable as any other existing or proposed solution.\r\n\r\nTim is currently doing most of the Python work, I agree. Previously we had a similar situation and that maintainer left the project and I had to step up and fix all the underdocumented and overcomplicated code. Tim could get hit by a bus tomorrow (I hope he doesn't!) and if that happens then we need the project to be at a stage where multiple (maybe even all) maintainers are in a position to understand the code and how it works.

Here is what I'd hope this refactoring would yield:\r\n\r\n- A method named `setup_test_formula(name)` that:\r\n  - Creates either of three possible formulae depending on the given `name`: `testball`, `foo`, or `bar`.\r\n  - Adds the path (a `Pathname` object) of the just created formula to an array `@formula_files`.\r\n  - Returns that same path for use within the calling `test_*` method.\r\n- A modified `teardown` method that:\r\n  - Iterates over the entries of `@formula_files` and unlinks all those files. No need to do this in every single test in the `ensure` block.\r\n- A lot of modified `test_*` methods that:\r\n  - Only use the path returned by the `setup_test_formula` method and refrain from touching the `@formula_files` instance variable.\r\n  - Quite a few dropped or shortened `ensure` blocks.\r\n\r\nI hope I was somewhat convincing. üò∏ I strongly believe this will combine the benefits of less boilerplate (already achieved in the current code) with greater clarity (explicitly requesting certain formulae by name and getting their path in return while avoiding implicitly defined instance variables).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo accommodate the currently unhandled cases where a more customized formula is needed, the method could be extended with a second argument to accept something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbaz_path = setup_test_formula \"baz\", <<-EOS.undent\r\n  desc \"The baz formula\"\r\n  url \"http://example.com/baz-0.1.tar.gz\"\r\n  depends_on \"foo\"\r\n  depends_on \"bar\" => :optional\r\nEOS\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow to still benefit from the auto-cleanup logic suggested above and the method could further reduce the necessary boilerplate code by providing the surrounding `class Baz` (generated with `Formulary.class_s` from `name`) and `end` lines.",

Normally, just removing the previous commit during `rebase` seems to bring the desired effect...\r\n\r\nI'm assuming you're talking about `git rebase -i`? You almost never want to remove individual commits in the sheet this brings up, as that indeed removes the changes made in the respective commits. This would also explain the merge conflicts as the follow-up adjustments depend on those changes. What you instead want to do in almost all cases is combine the changes from multiple commits, e.g. you leave the first commit at `pick` and change the next commit in the list from `pick` to `squash`. This will combine these two commits and ask you for the commit message of this combined commit in the process.\r\n\r\nOr use `git commit --amend`, if all you want to do is make adjustments to the most recent commit.\r\n\r\n> This may be because I blindly ran `git rebase -s recursive -X ours master` at some point during this process.

The libraries might exist in the given paths while `shellcheck` is built by the Glasgow Haskell compiler, but the end result is a statically linked binary that (as you correctly observed) only links to two system libraries.

Assuming it's a set of libraries, adding a new RPATH in a client binary is easier than adjusting all dylib load commands.\r\n\r\n> I'm wondering whether all `cmake`-compiled executables are non-relocatable due to `RPATH`.\r\n\r\nCertainly not.

If the symlink points to a file, then it will happily and transparently work with that. The real problem here was that directories were passed to `ruby-macho` for inspection. (Sorry! I didn't make this entirely clear.) The reason for also excluding symlinks during tree traversal is really just for consistency with other similar code in Homebrew and because checking the symlinks would be redundant here.",

(3) Manually symlink the brew binary, the brew man page, and the share/doc/homebrew dirs into the corresponding places in /usr/local. (4) the KEY STEP is to create an empty dir called `/usr/local/Cellar` before you try installing anything.  (5) Do `brew tap Homebrew/homebrew-core`.  (6) Do `brew doctor` just to make sure things are sane.\r\n\r\nThis way, HB will still have the Cellar under /usr/local, which means you can still take advantage of any bottles that aren't relocatable, and won't have problems with the odd formula that hardcodes something with /usr/local.  But, since all the HB stuff is tucked away in `~/foo`, you aren't forced to look at HB detritus in /usr/local.\r\n\r\nIf you skip step (4), HB will auto-create a Cellar under ~/foo.  This will work, but you won't be able to pour some bottles (the ones that aren't relocatable).\r\n\r\nThe whole process mentioned above is easily bash-scriptable if you want an unattended install.",

		"body" : "I agree with the general goal of this PR, but I think we need to clean up the logic a bit. Currently it's just dealing with too many cases in too many separate branches of the `if` statement. Here's a suggestion for how to basically re-implement the entire `eligible_kegs_for_cleanup` method:\r\n\r\n1. If none or only one version of a formula is installed, immediately return an empty array and don't complain at all.\r\n2. If at least two versions of a formula are installed:\r\n  1. Pick the currently linked version as a partition point. If none is linked, use the latest installed version.\r\n  2. Iterate over all installed versions and do one of:\r\n    1. If it's older than the partition point, it is eligible and should be cleaned up.\r\n    2. If it's identical to the partition point, it should stay.\r\n    3. If it's newer than the partition point, it isn't eligible, but it should produce a warning that this newer version was skipped/preserved.\r\n\r\nDoes this logic make sense? Have I missed an important use case? I think this approach massively simplifies the logic and yields the desired result. It always cleans up versions older than the one currently in use and leaves all newer versions alone (that might have been installed in the mean time). Those newer versions might exist because a user upgraded and then went back to an older version via `brew switch` because the newer version turned out to be problematic in some way.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this up and coming up with a PR!

But it took me a few moments to come up with this argument, so maybe that's not as intuitive/useful. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAnother thing you could do (because I just noticed in your snippet), is to structure the code as follows once you update your PR. This limits the amount of indentation and makes it a bit easier to read:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif installed_prefixes.length < 2\r\n  # Handle the simple case (zero or one installed version of a formula).\r\n  return []\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Handle the remaining cases (what would have previously been the `else` or `elsif` branch).\r\n```",

What I understood from that first added line is that, if there are fewer than 2 kegs installed, we only want to warn when skipping 1) the only keg (`any_version_installed?`), 2) that is not the newest version (`!installed?`), 3) is not pinned (`!pinned?`), and 4) is not linked (`!linked_keg.exist?`)... Does that make sense, or should I still drop that check?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd also like to write the tests first, but as I mentioned in the PR, it's not immediately clear how to write the tests I need without making some nontrivial additions to the existing testing infrastructure (though I only did a quick first glance+attempt and may be totally wrong..).\r\n\r\nThanks again for the advice and feedback, @UniqMartin!",

A very rough sketch would be:\r\n\r\n1. If applicable, use the built-in completion and be done.\r\n2. If it exists, use the `_brew_<command>` shell function and be done.\r\n3. If `brew command <command>` returns a path that points into the `cmd/` directory of a tap, use that to construct a path like `<tap>/cmd/completions/zsh/_brew_<command>` and try to source the file.

It checks each for autoload. If it's an autoloaded function it interacts with the default zsh autoload feature (load script from fpath when necessary). The `declare -f` line allows us to only call the autoloaded function if it's been previously defined / setup for autoload. If the function doesn't exist, it returns non-zero, so this does nothing if there's no other command defined. Otherwise, calling the function causes autoload to define the function body properly (and read the _brew_cask script / function in full) See https://github.com/joshka/zsh-completions/commit/31b4e82887626eee236a9806ec9c4f5dee90056c for the brew cask side of the funciton.\r\n\r\n> That's too bad. I think this would be really useful and it would be awesome if someone made the first step for the benefit of all external commands hosted in taps.\r\n\r\nI _personally_ think that the completions should belong in the homebrew cask repo rather than external, so that they can be versioned concurrently with the project, but the maintainers have suggested that they don't want it in the repo. See https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/22434#issuecomment-229008519. @vitorgalvao might be able to provide more context on why this is so.\r\n\r\n> This partially taps into the above question regarding auto-loading.

Automatic discovery of completions for external commands from taps would certainly be a topic worth investigating further, but doesn't need to happen in this PR.\r\n\r\nI tested your changes by additionally downloading the `_brew_cask` file you linked to. Everything worked as I would have expected. I'm inclined to merge your changes, but would feel more comfortable if any of the ZSH-using maintainers could briefly have a look.\r\n\r\n@apjanke Do you happen to have time to review this? I think the changes proposed here are fine.\r\n\r\n> I don't know how the tap side works and couldn't find the specific code that does this automatically.\r\n\r\nThere's currently no automatic way for taps, but it could become part of the `tap`/`untap` procedure, that currently already automatically handles man pages [in `Tap#link_manpages`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/0926f920dc48e297d569363acbb46d1058c6ba73/Library/Homebrew/tap.rb#L249-L270) and [in `Tap#unlink_manpages`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/0926f920dc48e297d569363acbb46d1058c6ba73/Library/Homebrew/tap.rb#L288-L296).

Cask would already be served by the change in this PR, but other projects might want to stick the completions into their tap repositories and make them an integral part of their commands. To me it makes a lot of sense to have them in the same repository and to update them together with commands and options being added and removed, but I respect if someone feels differently about this.\r\n\r\nThat said, that's often not happening when we perform those changes in Homebrew. Bash completions are seeing a bit more love (though they are also not exactly in sync), but ZSH completions are even worse. If you feel passionate about the latter, further PRs to improve them are more than welcome!",

		"body" : "> What is the reasoning behind disallowing the cleanup of older versions of formulas when the most recent is not installed?\r\n\r\nTechnically, Homebrew doesn't consider a formula to be installed unless the latest version it knows of is installed. And because only installed formulae (in the sense I explained here) are checked for older versions that could be cleaned up, this isn't happening.\r\n\r\nI guess for most users of Homebrew this isn't an issue, as they tend to update as soon as a new version is published. Thus, for them the `brew cleanup` logic behaves as expected. But I can sympathize with your use case and I think it is perfectly reasonable for cleanup to remove all but the most recent installed version of a formula, even if this version happens to be older than the latest available version.\r\n\r\nThat's not exactly an answer to your question, but to be honest I don't know why it was implemented as it is (this happened before my time with Homebrew) and I agree that this behavior is not ideal. What definitely needs to be factored into the decision is what version of a formula is currently linked into the prefix, as that one cannot be cleaned up. But I guess in your case this will always be the latest one you upgraded to (even if that's not the one Homebrew considers to be the latest).\r\n\r\n> Is there a simple way of removing older, inactive, versions of formulas when the most recent version is not yet installed?\r\n\r\nNone that I'm aware of. You'd basically had to do this manually by inspecting the ‚Äúrack‚Äù of a formula, i.e. the `Cellar/<formula>` directory in your Homebrew prefix, and then removing the ones that are no longer needed and making sure to retain the one that is currently linked and/or pinned. Certainly not ideal.\r\n\r\nClosing this as there's already PR #401 open to address this and I'm heading over there to provide feedback.

I continue to see merit in that, but the repeated lookup of the correct binary obviously has some downsides and that the lookup is done in Ruby doesn't help with performance.

At most a day seems like a reasonable middle ground where things are updated frequently enough without getting in the way on every single invocation. Some of the auto-updating GUI apps allow me to pick the frequency of those update checks, where the choice is usually daily, weekly, or even monthly.\r\n\r\n> The case we're trying to deal with is `brew install X` failing and it's already fixed if they had run `brew update`. Even if the update happened 30 seconds ago and we update at most every minute: that's not enough for this case.\r\n\r\nI think this is solving a manageable problem with a sledgehammer. And quite frankly, it's unrealistic that things will have changed this much in the last 30 seconds, or even 24 hours. I think we're mostly trying to address those cases that never (or almost never) update, they will be served well with a daily update, and I'm confident this is enough to solve about 90% of all issues that can actually be attributed to a stale Homebrew installation. Plus a failed installation already asks the user to `brew update` and try again.\r\n\r\nWith this argument that the issue might have been fixed in the past few seconds/minutes/hours, we could as well decide to auto-update after a failed installation and try again. Then repeat this cycle until the installation finally succeeds or the user aborts. (No, this is not a serious suggestion.)\r\n\r\n> We should optimise for the novice user case and then allow power users to customise this (i.e. the already existing opt-out).\r\n\r\nI'm fine with that. I'm probably going to disable the auto-update on my own machine for a bunch of reasons, all of which probably don't matter at all to a novice user, but matter to me:\r\n\r\n- I'm a power user and know what I want. I'm aware of my local repository state (including tap repositories) and want `brew install` to operate on that and not some (to me) unpredictable state after an automatic update. I also want to perform updates when that's convenient for me.\r\n\r\n- My repositories (both taps and the package manager) are frequently on a non-`master` branch. Auto-update doesn't help with these and updating them cannot be fully automated anyway.\r\n\r\n- My working copies are frequently in some intermediate state, including uncommitted files, pending Git operations and what not. I don't trust the automatism to always be able to fully stash away and restore this. I'm fine with cleaning up my working copy before I run `brew update`, but I don't want to have to do this while experimenting with other changes, many of which involve repeatedly running `brew install`.",

If, following the completion of the update, brew determines that any of the items involved in the install have actually been updated, it could go back to the beginning, and start over with the newer version(s).\r\n\r\nSince most of the time there will be no overlap between what the user is installing and what formulae actually got updated, in most cases there would be no additional time added to the installation and brew install would not block waiting on a pre-install update to finish. The corner case where the update takes longer than the install of the first item could be addressed by not finalizing the install of the first item until the update completes, which would then be the only case where this added time to installs.\r\n\r\n(Of course, I still think it would be nicer to have this run entirely asynchronously (launchd) or only do it on some arbitrary minimum interval between updates.)",

I think we should lean on `brew install git` instead for a few reasons:\r\n- Git updates quite often and has had a few major security issues that require a quick turnaround.

Since we have to vendor ruby anyway, the differential maintaining cost is less than the gain. Even more, vendor git and curl will never be used outside Homebrew.\r\n\r\n> We support installing from URLs e.g. brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/master/Formula/git.rb. If we want to improve this flow we could parse the tap name (e.g. org/repo) from this URL so the from-source Tab is correct.\r\n\r\nThis won't work for following reasons:\r\n* For old system like Tigerbrew and Linuxbrew, both git and curl have several hard dependencies. This renders `brew install url` unscalable. In comparison, vendor them as a single bundle is relative easier to handle.\r\n* On old systems, we have no choose but to use `curl --insecure` to download curl at least, due to  outdated curl and/or CA certs in those systems. If we use `vendor-install`, we can at least to guarantee the security by SHA256 checksum. While for `brew install URL`, there is no way to do it as the content of formula is changing all the time.\r\n\r\n> Git is required to install Homebrew so by the stage someone would receive this: they already have Git installed. While we could tweak our install process to not require Git it feels like that's not necessarily advantageous given how much still relies on having Xcode and/or the CLT installed on our supported versions of OS X.\r\n\r\nThis is not entirely true. [We still support to install Homebrew using curl instead of git](https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install#L246-L251)\r\n\r\nBesides the reasons mentioned above, there is a more important issue. For approach like `brew install URL`, it will mean that Homebrew will depend on some files which can be unlinked during brew install/reinstall/upgrade. And in those cases, Homebrew will be likely broken. This issue becomes more severe, when git and curl actually depend on other formulae which can also be unlinked. For example, in Linuxbrew land, if you are using git and curl from Homebrew, `brew upgrade` will break horribly if any of git/curl/openssl get update. The only solution is to do manually `brew fetch` as well as careful sort the installation order. Deep down, it is a very bad idea to mix Homebrew's dependencies with tools depend on Homebrew to install. In comparison, vendor system offer a nice and clean boundary to avoid such loop dependencies. \r\n\r\n",

In fact, those systems are more likely to use vendor git and curl due to the fact git and curl are missing or serious outdated in those systems.\r\n\r\nI don't think the core code being cross platform necessitates that we must provide portable, binary, vendored dependencies for each of these tools on each of these platforms. I think Ruby is a special case because it's required to run _any_ Homebrew/brew code and we've wanted to use Ruby 2 for a long time and it's the only way we can do so.\r\n\r\n> This can also be applied to ruby because it's bundled with openssl. Since we have to vendor ruby anyway, the differential maintaining cost is less than the gain. Even more, vendor git and curl will never be used outside Homebrew.\r\n\r\nRuby's OpenSSL is not used for downloads so it's not the same.

The vendor system (even once it's been documented/rolled out to users) adds a lot of maintenance overhead and process changes.\r\n\r\nRegardless: stepping aside for a minute: Homebrew/brew is not cross-platform yet and it's not being used by Tigerbrew. Linuxbrew requires you to `sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git python-setuptools ruby` to use Homebrew so there's other system-level dependencies there we're never going to provide. Linuxbrew is pretty far from using an unmodified Homebrew/brew. I think vendoring these just for versions of OS X we don't support is a mistake when they've been using the previous system fine. I'd like to see a clear user need for this  before we add the maintenance overhead and I'm really not seeing one yet.

It's clear that neither method is the correct solution, which made me dread pushing \"bad code\" to this branch (something that seemed unavoidable earlier). üò¨ \r\n\r\nThe problem here is twofold:\r\n\r\n1. One problem comes from the fact that the directory you're specifying for `HOMEBREW_TEMP` doesn't exist yet which confuses `Dir.mktmpdir` and friends and causes this alarming number of failures. The solution for this part is the same like for the scratch directory, i.e. create it in `testing_env.rb`. (This implies only deleting its children in `teardown`.)\r\n\r\n2. The other issue once the 1st part is addressed, is a bit more involved and is caused by historic limitations. Homebrew is using [UNIX domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) internally and because `Dir.tmpdir` defaults to the contents of the `TMPDIR` environment variable (inspect it yourself by executing `echo \"$TMPDIR\"` in a terminal) and that paths happens to be quite long already, affixing the additional path components crosses this historic limit and causes error messages like ‚Äútoo long unix socket path‚Äù. The only real solution is to make the path shorter and this is achieved by using, e.g.,  `/tmp` as is done by Homebrew [during a regular (non-test) run](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/91d32e77adf743510f0873e9195b3fe0dc065efd/Library/Homebrew/config.rb#L35-L36).\r\n\r\nThis is basically your commit, but with my modifications on top (in case any of the above prose isn't sufficiently accurate/clear) and without the test added by you:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/Library/Homebrew/test/lib/config.rb w/Library/Homebrew/test/lib/config.rb\r\nindex 062bed33..5818aec4 100644\r\n--- i/Library/Homebrew/test/lib/config.rb\r\n+++ w/Library/Homebrew/test/lib/config.rb\r\n@@ -2,10 +2,9 @@ require \"tmpdir\"\r\n require \"pathname\"\r\n \r\n HOMEBREW_BREW_FILE = Pathname.new(ENV[\"HOMEBREW_BREW_FILE\"])\r\n-HOMEBREW_TEMP = Pathname.new(ENV[\"HOMEBREW_TEMP\"] || Dir.tmpdir)\r\n \r\n TEST_TMPDIR = ENV.fetch(\"HOMEBREW_TEST_TMPDIR\") { |k|\r\n-  dir = Dir.mktmpdir(\"homebrew_tests\", HOMEBREW_TEMP)\r\n+  dir = Dir.mktmpdir(\"homebrew-tests-\", ENV[\"HOMEBREW_TEMP\"] || \"/tmp\")\r\n   at_exit { FileUtils.remove_entry(dir) }\r\n   ENV[k] = dir\r\n }\r\n@@ -24,6 +23,7 @@ HOMEBREW_CACHE_FORMULA = HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent+\"formula_cache\"\r\n HOMEBREW_LOCK_DIR      = HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent+\"locks\"\r\n HOMEBREW_CELLAR        = HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent+\"cellar\"\r\n HOMEBREW_LOGS          = HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent+\"logs\"\r\n+HOMEBREW_TEMP          = HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent+\"temp\"\r\n \r\n TESTBALL_SHA1 = \"be478fd8a80fe7f29196d6400326ac91dad68c37\"\r\n TESTBALL_SHA256 = \"91e3f7930c98d7ccfb288e115ed52d06b0e5bc16fec7dce8bdda86530027067b\"\r\ndiff --git i/Library/Homebrew/test/test_integration_cmds.rb w/Library/Homebrew/test/test_integration_cmds.rb\r\nindex c020deaf..07068019 100644\r\n--- i/Library/Homebrew/test/test_integration_cmds.rb\r\n+++ w/Library/Homebrew/test/test_integration_cmds.rb\r\n@@ -18,6 +18,7 @@ class IntegrationCommandTests < Homebrew::TestCase\r\n       HOMEBREW_CACHE.children,\r\n       HOMEBREW_LOCK_DIR.children,\r\n       HOMEBREW_LOGS.children,\r\n+      HOMEBREW_TEMP.children,\r\n       HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"bin\",\r\n       HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"share\",\r\n       HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"opt\",\r\ndiff --git i/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb w/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb\r\nindex 214aa978..e55f3f14 100644\r\n--- i/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb\r\n+++ w/Library/Homebrew/test/testing_env.rb\r\n@@ -7,7 +7,7 @@ require \"formulary\"\r\n \r\n # Test environment setup\r\n (HOMEBREW_LIBRARY/\"Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula\").mkpath\r\n-%w[cache formula_cache locks cellar logs].each { |d| HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent.join(d).mkpath }\r\n+%w[cache formula_cache locks cellar logs temp].each { |d| HOMEBREW_PREFIX.parent.join(d).mkpath }\r\n \r\n # Test fixtures and files can be found relative to this path\r\n TEST_DIRECTORY = File.dirname(File.expand_path(__FILE__))\r\n```",

The thing is, we currently have two rather orthogonal changes in this PR and in a single commit:\r\n\r\n- Change how the temporary directory is setup and handled during the tests.\r\n- Addition of a test for `brew irb`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have this reflected in two separate commits. If I'm asking too much, I'm happy to lend a helping hand in the chat or to do the split for you when merging the changes.\r\n\r\nTo give a practical example to motivate this: Let's assume we have overlooked some subtlety in how the redefinition of the temporary directory affects the test code and it's starting to act up. (Of course I'm always hoping for the best.) The easiest way to deal with such a situation, particularly if it becomes a pressing issue, is to revert the commit with the problematic changes (to bring them back later in revised form). If the `brew irb` changes were part of the same commit, they would also be reverted despite being perfectly fine and not the source of the problem.",

It'd be a good amount of work, and we'd only be gaining a convenience, and for probably a small proportion of Homebrew users.\r\n\r\nWe could do the detection: that's already done when picking what shell configuration file (e.g. `~/.profile` or `~/.zshrc`) to tell users to edit in the caveats. (Though I don't think it's 100% reliable, and probably can't be, due to the variety of scenarios `brew` might be invoked under.)\r\n\r\nBut it'd be work, and would make the caveats less readable for developers and `sh` users. (If we did `fish`, we should probably include `tcsh`, `ksh`, and `zsh` as well, which might differ. And I don't think we have experts in `fish` or other shells besides `bash` and `zsh`.) And if we didn't get it 100% (for both shell detection reliability, and coverage of code snippets to be translated), then you still might have the odd case where the user gets presented with a snippet of shell code, and they have to wonder whether it's been correctly \"localized\" for their shell, or if it's defaulted back to `bash` and needs to be translated. So they'd have to examine the code for syntax clues anyway.\r\n\r\nSince most of the shell code examples out in the wild seem to be `sh`/`bash`, users of \"alternative\" shells like `fish` and `csh` are probably used to having to translate anyway; it's part of the price of admission. Seems like it would keep things simpler to do things that way in `brew`, too.\r\n\r\nAutomating the translation would make it easier and maintain readability. We could just do all the code snippets in bash and mark them up as shell code, and use a translation library to mechanically convert them to other shells.

Since your library isn't installed to that directory tree, it isn't found.\r\n\r\nThe reason why `xcode-select --install` fixes it for them is that it installs a toolchain independent of Xcode and switches the compiler etc. wrappers in `/usr/bin` to use that instead. This effectively changes the SDK root to `/` and thus libraries in `/usr/local/lib` are automatically picked up.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to modify the instructions for your users to ask them to explicitly include `-I` and `-L` flags for your library's include/library paths, making your instructions work independently of the user's exact setup and where Homebrew happens to be installed.",

I guess that's a nice way to have more practice with `git rebase`. üò∏ In the future, those kinds of conflicts could be minimized if the test methods were roughly added in alphabetical order instead of appending them to the existing ones. (But there's nothing fundamentally wrong with how you've done things thus far.)\r\n\r\nGood idea, thanks! I'll keep this in mind for future reference. In the meantime, yes, it has been good to have more practice with `git rebase` (which is exactly what I've just done for this branch). üòÑ \r\n\r\n> In some cases the command output itself isn't very useful and checking it additionally doesn't provide any added value. But more often than not the expected failure cannot be trivially inferred from the invocation alone, thus an assert on the error message provides an additional clue as to what the test is checking. (And the additional assert is basically free, as it is significantly less expensive than the `cmd[_fail]` call.)\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation!",

My suggestion is to remove the `edit on` command from your `~/.editrc` file.

Cleaning up the cache would become a two-step process: First identify all symbolic links that can be removed and do so, then remove all blobs not referenced by any symbolic link in the cache repository. (The second step should be really cheap because it's just a file system traversal not involving any formula loading.)\r\n\r\nBecause duplicate blobs are now really cheap, we could force *all* things for a specific formula version into a `<formula>/<pkg_version>` directory (as hinted at in the tree above).

Homebrew has stated that the filesystem (and command stdout) are our interface and I think favouring simplicity is wise as it makes it easier to interoperate with other e.g. Unix tools. In this case a simple solution will be easier to implement and maintain. As mentioned, we can investigate more complicated deduplication later (for which I still favour hard links) but this issue is relatively tightly scoped to a new cache subdirectory format.",

One reason is that it would make accidentally cloning arbitrary repositories that are definitely not taps with `brew tap` much more likely.

The other option is to have a custom handler for `SIGPIPE` or to mask this signal. The latter causes `write` to return `EPIPE` which is translated to the exception handled here.\r\n\r\nSo yes, in some sense this is also happening if executed in a shell, but we don't usually see the broken pipe error as it isn't considered a true error in most circumstances. E.g. in `cat file.txt | head -n 1` it is actually desirable that `head` dies after it has output the first line, so that the pipe is broken and `cat` can learn its pointless to continue reading the input file. (Whether `cat` internally relies on the default `SIGPIPE` behavior or checks for the `EPIPE` return value I don't know.)\r\n\r\nBecause the Homebrew process is doing a lot more than just feeding input to that helper (unlike in the `cat` example above), it makes sense to actually handle the broken pipe and then move on instead of being killed by the OS.",

Consequently, the code will continue to make unauthenticated GitHub API requests and either return the desired search results or report back with an error that the rate limit has been exceeded. That error also suggests to create and set a token, thus a possibly incomplete search result shouldn't be causing much confusion‚Äîcertainly less than the broken pipe error. (See my top comment for an example output for the rate limit case.)\r\n\r\n> Why it preferable to return `[]` rather than give an explicit, custom error to the users?\r\n\r\nBecause it is just one of several options and not having the credentials available this way isn't a fatal condition. We can still try and often succeed with an unauthenticated request. Maybe it's an unusual configuration on macOS, but it's still perfectly legal to have a Git installation without this credentials helper and making its absence stop the rest of the processing in its tracks didn't feel appropriate. If we wanted to make the user aware of this issue, I think the best thing we can do is output a warning.

		"body" : "# Problem\r\n\r\nThe question raised in this PR is using long git commit hashes and short git commit hashes.\r\nThe format of the HEAD-versions we use is the following: `HEAD-<version>_<revision>`, where version is a commit hash. There are plenty of download strategies, but I refer only to `GitDownloadStrategy` here, because others have either other 'commit' structure or no short-hashes support.\r\n\r\nTo compare two HEAD version we need to compare commit hashes. And this is what this PR is about. Suppose we only store long hashes. So, to detect if installed HEAD-version is outdated we need to compare upstream hash of the project with hash used in installed HEAD-version prefix. If they are the same, then installed HEAD is up-to-date, otherwise we have outdated HEAD.\r\n\r\nLet's now suppose we use short hashes. What we do to detect outdated versions is a) calling `VCSDownloadStrategy#last_commit` which goes to cached location and gets the hash and b) compare returned `last_commit` with HEAD-prefix. If it any time `last_commit` increases its length, then installed HEAD-prefix cannot be equal to it anymore, thus, it's outdated.\r\n\r\nMore precisely:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls /usr/local/Cellar/ack\r\nHEAD-a0a0a0a\r\n\r\n==> Interactive Homebrew Shell\r\nExample commands available with: brew irb --examples\r\n2.0.0-p481 :001 > Formulary.factory(\"ack\").head.downloader.last_commit\r\n => \"a0a0a0a0\"\r\n2.0.0-p481 :002 > ^D\r\n```\r\nThat means that `a0a0a0a` is no longer unique within the repo, but it was when we installed `HEAD-a0a0a0a`, therefore HEAD is outdated.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when we introduce `GitGitHubDownloadStrategy` to be able to detect outdated versions without fetching a repository. `GitGitHubDownloadStrategy#last_commit` returns full-length hash. The problem is that we can't check installed hash and fetched hash for equality anymore. What we can is to perform `start_with?` check, but it still can't guarantee the version is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ls $(brew --cellar)/ack\r\nHEAD-b090608c\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's now suppose we want to check if `HEAD-b09060c` is outdated\r\nusing GitHub API, which return full-length prefix and let's\r\nsuppose it returns the following hash:\r\n\r\n```\r\nb090608c49643099a47247d79ac9ca80d05c2ee0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do we treat it? Is the HEAD version outdated or not? Suppose\r\nit's not since prefixes are the same. After a while we check it\r\nagain and GitHub API returns the following hash:\r\n\r\n```\r\nb090608c00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, we still think our installed HEAD is up-to-date, however\r\nthat's not true.\r\n\r\n# Workaround\r\n\r\n* Store long hashes in Tab. Cons: complicate.\r\n* Use short commits and use `==` for `VCSDownloadStrategy` and `start_with?` for `GitHubDownloadStrategy`. Cons: there is a possibility we get outdated version (see the example).\r\n* Store long hashes everywhere. Cons: long hashes in `outdated` outputs and long prefixes.\r\n\r\nFor now long hashes used everywhere in the code and even if we use short hashes for git we cannot escape from long hashes for other VCSs.\r\n\r\n@xu-cheng ",

While this won't be perfect, the likelihood of this failing would be close to 0% if the shortened hash isn't overly short, e.g. 16 characters. Even if this wasn't sufficient to uniquely identify all commits, it would only affect a few commits and in extremely big Git repositories with millions if not billions of commits and objects.\r\n\r\n> - Store long hashes everywhere. Cons: long hashes in `outdated` outputs and long prefixes.\r\n\r\nThis could be partially addressed by using a more efficient encoding that uses fewer characters at the expense of no longer having hex digits and thus adding an additional layer of abstraction that might complicate matters. E.g. by re-encoding the full commit hash in Base32, its length could be shortened from 40 to 32 characters. (Just wanted to mention this theoretical possibility. I don't think this is a practical solution due to its complexity.)",

Seems like [`curl_output`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/utils/curl.rb#L22-L34) never fails, so we probably need something like this:\r\n```ruby\r\n  def fetch_last_commit\r\n    return unless head?\r\n    commit = github_last_commit || super\r\n    version.update_commit(commit)\r\n    commit\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\n* 2. Do we need to check that last fetched commit not `nil`, maybe raise an Error or something?\r\n* 3. How do I change `print_outdated_json` behaviour if `--fetch-HEAD` flag passed.\r\n\r\nAlso, what if we changhe `--fetch-HEAD` to `--fetch-head`?",

There's nothing inherently wrong or broken about the code, it's just that it doesn't fully conform to certain code style guidelines.\r\n\r\nAside from this there's also a minor issue with the commit subject (and PR title). The way I tend to read them is `<area of changed code>: <what was changed>` and in this spirit a more fitting subject would be `tests: fix code style issues` or something similar.\r\n\r\n> - `Method definitions must not be nested. Use lambda instead.`\r\n>   - these method definitions all (or mostly) seem to be enclosed within `formula do` blocks; does it make sense to convert these to lambdas? (I haven't yet figured out a way to do so that passes `brew tests`.)\r\n\r\nThis is one of those cases where refactoring is unlikely to make sense and RuboCop suggests a solution that doesn't apply because it fails to understand the full context of the surrounding code. Depending on whether this affects individual lines or short blocks of code, the best solution is to suppress those complaints by temporarily disabling one or more cops, as [detailed in the RuboCop documentation](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#disabling-cops-within-source-code).\r\n\r\n> - `Use snake_case for method names.`\r\n>   - examples of these methods include `test_check_DYLD_vars` and `test_create_DATA`; it seems like these acronyms are best kept as-is.\r\n\r\nTrue. Silencing the relevant cop is the best way to address this and to drop the violation count.\r\n\r\n> - `Prefer to_s over string interpolation.`\r\n>   - these bugs are easy to fix, but many instances of string interpolation seem to be tolerated by `brew style` (e.g., in `test_integration_cmds`; why is that?\r\n\r\nThis mostly sounds like a misunderstanding to me, i.e. in which contexts this suggestion applies. `\"#{something}\"` is an unnecessary use of string interpolation because there's only the variable `something` and no surrounding text or other variables, thus `something` (if it is a string) or `something.to_s` (if it can be converted to a string) is more appropriate. \"#{something}\\n\" instead is a perfectly fine use of string interpolation.\r\n\r\n> I'm sensing that Rubocop's opinions are meant to be guidelines (rather than gospel), but maybe I'm wrong!\r\n\r\nIndeed, they are guidelines and where possible, we have tweaked the settings because our preferred style doesn't fully align with what RuboCop considers to be the best default. It can sometimes make sense to tweak a rule instead of ‚Äúfixing‚Äù our code, though most suggestions and defaults are good (and just show how old and diverse some of our code base is).",

I thought I remembered hearing these issues referred to as \"bugs\" some time ago, but I see that that isn't the most accurate way to refer to them. I've updated the commit and PR title, though the branch still carries the old name. üò¨ \r\n\r\nThanks for pointing me to the Rubocop documentation on temporarily disabling cops. I've done this for the **`Method definitions must not be nested`** and **`Use snake_case for method names`** warnings. I followed the example of some [existing calls to `rubocop:disable`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/9e7b8c61a99c4d4c69da36f95759e375b7a4e116/Library/Homebrew/compat/hardware.rb#L3-L4) and included a code comment explaining the purpose of disabling Rubocop (one comment per type of cop, per file).\r\n\r\nI also removed the string interpolation in [`test_formulary`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/587/files#diff-37389a0e65da3f23aad3b3b96636d8e0L134) and [`test_tap`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/587/files#diff-3676702e08834bbec8ee89f8f9869981L184) since it was unnecessary in both instances (I hadn't actually examined these offenses before).\r\n\r\nIt's probably obvious that I approached this task with haste and impatience, so I've learned my lesson. Thank you @UniqMartin and @DomT4 for taking a closer look here! üòÅ \r\n\r\n9 Rubocop offenses remain in `Homebrew/test`; I hope it's OK for these to stay on the back-burner for now:\r\n```\r\n== test_dependency_collector.rb ==\r\nC: 10: 40: Avoid the use of the case equality operator ===.\r\n== test_ENV.rb ==\r\nW: 31:  5: Do not suppress exceptions.\r\nW: 31:  5: Avoid rescuing the Exception class.

In this case we're dealing with simple strings and `/` simply doesn't make sense.",

And if your crypto component relies on OpenSSL as a backend and cannot use the libraries natively provided by the OS, the most user-friendly solution would be to bundle those external dependencies to make your package fully self-contained.\r\n\r\nYeah, but then we're in the boat of needing to release an updated Mac release every time there's an OpenSSL security fix, which (I'm sure you're aware) is a fairly regular occurrence.\r\n\r\nSo, since we've already shipped, and this change now makes our getting started instructions not function, do you have any particular recommendations? Is there an ABI-version-only path under a default `brew install` that we can use as the target of a symlink (I can't easily check since I don't have my Mac with me; and last time we found 'a working solution' it got taken away :smile:)?  That is, `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` is a path using the patch version, which changes frequently.  `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` (if guaranteed) is better, `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` is great, assuming that 1.1.0 (incompatible ABI) would be side-by-side in that location.  `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.0/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` would also be good, using the library ABI version in the path (instead of the library release version).\r\n\r\nOur goals:\r\n* MacOS users can use .NET Core\r\n* Security updates to OpenSSL can be delivered to users independent of our release schedule\r\n* While documentation may assume a single dependency source (e.g. homebrew), have no hard dependence on that dependency source\r\n* Have as simple of getting started instructions as possible given preceding goals\r\n\r\nHeck, now that I've written this I feel like I have to ask: Why can't `brew install openssl` symlink in the (versioned) library assets already?  Since they're versioned they don't compete with the old 0.9.8 library, and with no unversioned name it doesn't change default linker behaviors.",

That you had to use the `--force` option should have made you think. It's a power-user option to accommodate certain use cases, but it's not something I would suggest lightly to users that don't understand the consequences (and apparently nobody writing those instructions did). That's all okay and understandable, but I don't think it's fair to shift responsibility of fixing your use case to us because we noticed the abuse and made it harder to perform an unsafe and security-relevant operation (without an advance warning because there was no contact information).\r\n\r\nIt's obviously up to your project how you operate and where your priorities are, but I think on that matter you should really consider bundling OpenSSL as a short-term solution and then port your SSL/TLS layer to use Secure Transport on macOS as long-term solution (because that's what Apple expects you to use and where you are covered by the vendor's security updates).",

In formula tests, we only seem to use `MiniTest` if it is available and I'm not sure for what versions of Ruby it is guaranteed to be there. Otherwise we fall back to `Unit::Test` only (in which case we cannot use the `refute_*` family of assertions). I guess it's a bit hard to correctly code against a common subset, if what gets exposed is usually more. üòï",

Any particular reason its started happening this evening\r\n\r\nPeople executing `brew install` or `brew fetch` on SHA1 formulae have been seeing a warning for a while. It was turned into a more severe fail yesterday as the deprecation timetable edges ahead, without the formulae actually needing to be executed by a user. We may need to see how that goes.\r\n\r\nEssentially carrying around so much old code is problematic on a number of levels & makes looking after Homebrew considerably harder, which degrades UX over time. Consequently, we try & gently nudge external taps to follow our lead and update the syntax/checksum every now and again with tools like `brew audit` but sometimes that's not noisy enough for people to take notice of üòï.\r\n\r\nIn the very short term I'd recommend reporting it to the upstream taps that they need to move their formulae over to SHA256. I've done that for every tap you've listed in your post & https://github.com/killercup/homebrew-openresty have already fixed their issue at least.\r\n\r\nDespite the noise things _should_ actually be updating & upgrading fine.\r\n\r\nCC @MikeMcQuaid.",

The more complicated cases will use `virtualenv_create` and operate on the returned `Virtualenv` instance. For these, the only difference will be to replace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvenv.link_scripts(bin) { venv.pip_install buildpath }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvenv.pip_install buildpath, :link_scripts => bin\r\n```\r\n\r\n> any thoughts on having install & install_and_link, and exposing even less of this?\r\n\r\nI'm fine with that and it would be a trivial change.

It will make the formula `foo@1.0` and `foo@2.0` share the same prefix. Which in turns can solve many potential problems:\r\n\r\n* It handles conflicts among different version automatically  without the need of manually declaring `conflicts_with`(which it's not scalable)\r\n* It supports `brew switch`. And allow users to manage which version is active one(i.e. exposed to the PATH).\r\n* In long term, we can even replace `--devel`, `--HEAD` with aliases like `foo@devel` and `foo@HEAD`. So I can run `brew install foo@devel bar@HEAD baz` (which it's impossible for now).\r\n* For `brew bundle`, it means that we can finally support version check.  \r\n\r\nThe main point is to let homebrew understand `foo.rb` and `foo@1.0.rb` as well their installation kegs are indeed the same formula with different version. And handle conflict in the process using existing codes.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does require us to store `@1.0` suffix in the tab file.\r\n\r\nThis is just my thought to be shared.",

But these issues already can come up today, its simply a question of whether we want to continue to relegate them to the sidelines or not. The problem is exacerbated once we explicitly allow devel dependencies, but hopefully with this better information we can guide users as to how to fix them better.\r\n\r\n",

The OSX version seems to be irrelevant, as I have had the issue with both OSX 10.10 and 10.11 (haven't tried with other versions though)?\r\n\r\nNot sure why you ask about the country, but FWIW we thought it could be a time sync issue and tried to force sync with ntp, as well as changing the timezone the VM's were on to the actual timezone (they were on US pacific by default) \r\n\r\nAlso I stumbled on this  SO question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30385939/git-clone-fails-with-sslread-error-on-os-x-yosemite/30441332) which describes an issue that looks very similar to the one I encounter, however the suggested fix is to install curl with openssl... via homebrew. \r\n\r\nLastly, this could be completely coincidental, but the packer builds were run as a daily job in jenkins (setup around the end of April 2016), and were mostly succeeding in May/June and then started failing much more often at the end of June / beginning of July. At which point the jenkins job was set to run every two hours so we could understand what was going on.\r\nThere doesn't seem to be a pattern with regard to the time the build is ran and whether or not it fails.\r\n\r\nMind, we had already encountered this same error before the builds started failing so often but shrugged it off as a random network error, so I don't think the issue comes from a change in the curl script (and also tried to run jenkins builds that \"manually\" try to install homebrew in a way that mimicks what the curl script does, to the best of my ability, but this one succeeded 100% of the time).\r\n\r\nProbably should have included all that info in my initial post...

We don't keep track of dependencies explicitly yet (but will when we implement https://github.com/Homebrew/brew-evolution/blob/master/003-install-bottles-of-arbitrary-versions.md CC @sjackman) so for now this would be tricky. `brew missing`/`brew doctor` do the opposite to what you've said and will shout if you've removed something you shouldn't have.\r\n\r\nAs this is a feature request: would you mind refiling it on either Homebrew/brew or, ideally, write a proposal for Homebrew/brew-evolution?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

I do however think that `brew cleanup` could remove unused `:build` dependencies that were not explicitly installed by the user (and are not a `:run` dependency of an installed package). For that, Brew would need to keep track of which packages the user asked to be installed at the command line, and which were installed as the dependency of another package. The latter is a feature of the Debian `apt-get autoremove` command, which removes the requested package as well as all its unused dependencies that were not explicitly requested by the user. That would actually be a nice feature for Brew as well.\r\n\r\nTwo features here, both which require tracking why a package was installed, explicit request by user vs as a dependency of another package.\r\n\r\n1. `brew autoremove` removes the requested package and any of its unneeded dependencies not explicitly requested by the user.\r\n2. `brew cleanup` removes any unneeded dependencies not explicitly requested by the user.",

However, I think we've just discovered a more fundamental issue, namely that some code in Homebrew allows the spec to be overridden by a command-line argument like `--HEAD` even if the formula is initialized from an installed keg and the corresponding tab file clearly indicates a different spec for the installed formula. I think we have basically two options to resolve this, both of which diverge from the current behavior:\r\n\r\n- Use the spec from the tab file (if it exists) and ignore the spec given via command-line arguments.\r\n- Raise an error if the spec in the tab file (if it exists) and the spec given via command-line arguments don't match.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure of the full ramifications of this change in behavior, thus any feedback on this (and whether this suggestion even makes sense) is greatly appreciated.",

But then I thought what `Formulary` was used for. `Formulary` has different methods to generate `Formula` instance, so I thought that `from_keg` is needed to get the formula instance of that keg and `spec` just sets the spec we want that formula to have. After I realised that it didn't seem that strange to me, because it was better than get formula instance and then set the spec manually. That said, maybe I'm missing something.",

Given that there's no strict requirement for fat binary to be consistent with respect to their linkage and RPATHs, inconsistent fat binaries are perfectly valid, and some (though very few) system fat binaries on macOS are inconsistent, I think we best stick to the previous behavior (compatible with install_name_tool) as far as Homebrew is concerned.\r\n\r\nAgreed.",

For that reason we often rely on the package manager itself to be at least as up-to-date as the tap (the reverse situation is usually less problematic if the formula is fine). That may become less important once the package manager stabilizes and reaches 1.0.0, but even then we'll have to keep tweaking it in a timely manner to adapt to OS and build system changes.",

Whilst this may seem hostile to some at this point it's going to become the norm.\r\n\r\nIf we want to really shove this change onto people hard we could bump the `gnupg` formula revision & add a `depends_on :gpg` line, which is of course an outright lie, but means every existing `gnupg` user who isn't using anything else in `homebrew/core` that `depends_on :gpg` would have their `gpg` symlink replaced now.",

The remote option does not meet that high bar. It is a highly localized option that only applies to a given invocation of the command (because it's specific to the tap being bumped).

		"body" : "I don't have a strong opinion on the right approach here; my goal was just to make sure you had the tools to solve the broken packages before macOS GM'ed.  But let me see if I can sort out the various cases.\r\n\r\nThere are three versions at play here:\r\n  - The SDK version, which is determined by which Xcode is installed.\r\n  - The OS version the user is running.\r\n  - The deployment target set by the code, or the OS version if none.\r\n\r\n`OS == SDK == deployment` is the common case of building random autoconf-based open source software on the latest macOS.  In this case, `-no_weak_imports` should be a noop.\r\n\r\n`OS == deployment < SDK` is the case where you are on OS X 10.11 with Xcode 8.  When building software that wasn't written with macOS-style weak linking and a specific deployment target in mind (likely including almost everything that uses autoconf), this is what `-no_weak_imports` will fix (or at least move from a runtime failure to a build time failure).\r\n\r\n`deployment < OS == SDK` and `deployment < OS < SDK` are situations where the developer almost certainly wanted the old weak-linking behavior.  Go falls into this bucket and we shouldn't add `-no_weak_imports` here.\r\n\r\nOkay, so a few thoughts on how to proceed:\r\n  - If there's a way to detect when the project is passing `-mmacos-version-min=` and avoid adding `-no_weak_imports`, that's almost certainly a good thing to do.  If not, you'll need an opt-out for such projects.\r\n  - Only applying the flag when `OS < SDK` will likely result in fewer broken builds for users, but also hides issues that only occur when in that situation.  e.g. if that was the current behavior, we wouldn't know that Go was broken in that situation.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!

There is a way to do this but only on a single compiler invocation e.g. if you pass `clang -mmacos-version-min=10.6 -Wl,no_weak_imports` we can filter out the `-Wl,no_weak_imports` but if e.g. `clang -mmacos-version-min=10.6` was used by one call and `clang -Wl,no_weak_imports` by another we would not be able to filter that out as we don't track state between compiler invocations.

There are things I don't particularly like about this PR at the moment:\r\n\r\n- I don't fully understand why a user would want to invoke a Homebrew that they have installed in `/usr/local/homebrew` (and where the prefix is `/usr/local`) by directly invoking `/usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew`. Shouldn't such a user rely on `/usr/local/bin` and make sure not to add `/usr/local/homebrew/bin` to PATH?\r\n  - I just realized this is motivated in the PR body by having `bin` in PATH which is IMO a really bad idea, as it makes pretty much every invocation on the command line context-sensitive (the context being the current working directory). A lot of code isn't prepared to deal with relative paths in PATH (including our own code as #778 has revealed).\r\n\r\n- We're special-casing `/usr/local` here. The same logic won't help if Homebrew is installed outside of `/usr/local` and `HOMEBREW_PREFIX != HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY`.\r\n\r\n- <sup>(#)</sup>The mere presence of a `/usr/local/bin/brew` symlink alters the behavior of `bin/brew`. It will reset `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` to `/usr/local` no matter what `/usr/local/bin/brew` resolves to and no matter where the currently executing `bin/brew` lives in (or whether it is related to `/usr/local/bin/brew` at all).\r\n\r\n<sup>(#)</sup>I'm pretty sure that's just a bug in the current implementation and not intended.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI wonder if all of this could be addressed more elegantly and without being limited to `/usr/local` if we kept a link (or simple text file) somewhere in `HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY` that points back to `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`. We only support a 1:1 relationship between the two, so that should be fine. That back link could be established on Homebrew install or on the first `bin/brew` invocation that finds this back link to be missing (in the hopes that the first invocation will run the correct `bin/brew`).",

I don't agree that the observed behavior is a bug. Homebrew has been inferring its prefix and repository path solely from the path it has been invoked with since its conception. If this changes due to the presence or absence of a symbolic link at a hard-coded location, that's a change that will result in surprising and inconsistent behavior for users that have a setup similar to you and happen to have Homebrew installed outside of `/usr/local`.\r\n\r\n> I think it's more elegant to not require a separate file be added and maintained when the symlink does this for you.\r\n\r\nI agree that maintaining a separate file is usually a bad idea.

		"body" : "> Do we know of more software that tends to put their sockets there or is Emacs an isolated case?\r\n\r\nI personally don't have many pieces of software that open sockets, and even fewer put their sockets in the global tmpdir. On top of head I can think of tmux, but with a bit of testing, tmux doesn't seem to care about `TMPDIR`, `TEMP` or `TMP`, at least not by default.\r\n\r\nActually, even if there are more software that does this, how many are going to be started inside brew's environment? Emacs is relevant here because `emacsclient` can be used as `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` which is used by `brew edit`.\r\n\r\n> Is there an easy way to change the socket path?\r\n\r\nOne can set `server-socket-dir` to override the default inside one's init file, but I doubt many people know this; it's hardly documented in the GNU Emacs Manual.\r\n\r\nEven if `server-socket-dir` is not set, the problem is not as severe as it may sound. `emacsclient` with the `-a ''` option can start a Emacs daemon if one isn't present already, and presumably many people take advantage of this (for instance, my `VISUAL` is a wrapper around `emacsclient -nw -cqta= \"$@\"`). In that case, not being able to find the existing socket in `TMPDIR` would simply mean another daemon is started with socket inside `HOMEBREW_TEMP`. Having two Emacs daemon might be devastating in the olden \"Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping\" days, but today I doubt anyone will give a damn, except in certain cases, like trying to switch to another frame but can't find it on the server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think Emacs is a rather isolated case, and we can document the workarounds somewhere if that's desirable.",

		"body" : "Thanks for taking a stab at this, but I think this goes into the wrong direction and further reinforces a not so good style. My personal opinion is that we should make the styling more semantic rather than hard-coding the style on every use (think of templates rather than direct formatting in word processing). Examples:\r\n\r\n- `#{Tty.red.underline}Error#{Tty.reset}` should be `#{Tty.error}Error#{Tty.reset}` and the exact styling (currently red and underlined) an implementation detail of the `Tty.error` method.\r\n\r\n  I think it would be nice to also style the following colon in this and similar cases (warning, ‚Ä¶), but that's a different debate.\r\n\r\n- `#{Tty.underline}URL#{Tty.reset}` (previously `#{Tty.em}URL#{Tty.reset}`) should be `#{Tty.url}URL#{Tty.reset}`.\r\n\r\nNot only will this make styling more consistent, but it will also expose when we have too many different styles and the output becomes more colorful and varied than useful. If we can keep the number of `Tty.<predefined_style>` methods limited, this will come almost for free.\r\n\r\n> *No description provided.*\r\n\r\nI appreciate your work a lot, but I would be a bit happier if you could provide some description of your PRs. Mainly a why and some high-level overview would be nice to have, as those aren't immediately obvious from looking at the diff. This doesn't have to be long, but the length should be non-zero except for small self-explanatory or urgent fixes.",

Even the things we write down are reorganised on the fly as necessary, such as SHA1, which is currently due to be hard blocked next month but likely won't be. My usage does meet one of the definitions of the word \"policy\" though, FWIW üòú.\r\n\r\nYou yourself discussing `numpy` made a slight virtual scrunched up face about using a non-core formula, way back in https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/pull/36810. I think you may have been the only one to make objection noises to it there, though.\r\n\r\nThere is precedent for kicking Requirements back to taps unless said requirement is going to be used by core formulae, see https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/pull/46448, sort of reinforced by planning to move the `osxfuse` requirement to `homebrew/fuse` until we decided to permit optional linkage in core formulae.\r\n\r\nI agree upgrading `open-mpi` because it passed CI, despite the extreme majority of formulae that use it residing in `science`, is not exactly ideal. I'm unconvinced though that either `konoha` or `lcdf-typetools` can be called Science formulae, and currently they would be migrated in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/4274.\r\n\r\nI think cross-tap `default_formula` is probably fine as long as we're aware either:\r\n\r\n* Everything that uses that requirement by default or `:recommended` needs to live in the same tap as the `default_formula`, regardless of where those formulae would ideally live or:\r\n* We essentially introduce cross-tap dependencies to any `:mpi`-using bottles, and potentially end up accidentally doing cross-tap CI testing every now & again.\r\n\r\nGiven where these formulae would be heading, probably not a bad idea to CC @Homebrew/science.",

I still don't see what the point of the gitconfig modifications are. \r\n\r\nWe want some behaviour to be for Homebrew developers and some behaviour to not be defaulted for them. We need to use `gitconfig` to set some state. At the moment instead of `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER` a better description might be `HOMEBREW_I_INTENTIONALLY_MAKE_GIT_MODIFICATIONS_AND_UNDERSTAND_HOW_TO_RESOLVE_PROBLEMS_THAT_RESULT_WITHOUT_NEEDING_HELP`. This could have been better explained but there's basically been two contradicting forces leading to this PR:\r\n\r\n- Novice Homebrew users used to (relatively regularly) end up in a state where `brew update` couldn't update because of the state of their Git repository. Alternatively, they updated but lingering files meant Homebrew did not behave correct. Also, people would often file issues due to not runnign `brew update` in a while. These all produced hard-to-debug or just waste-of-time issues which seemingly entirely gone away now.\r\n- The new behaviour where we clean up the Git repository is surprising or annoying for Homebrew developers (e.g. anyone who makes brew/homebrew-core/tap PRs). This annoyed people a bit before but has been exacerbated by auto-update.\r\n- There's some commands targeted at Homebrew developers that we want more people to have access to and be documented accordingly without needing to set an environment variable.\r\n\r\n(the above description should have been in the PR description).\r\n\r\n@ilovezfs @tdsmith How about this: instead of setting `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER` globally we have a `HOMEBREW_RUN_DEVELOPER_COMMAND` which changes purely the stash/reset/checkout behaviour of `brew update`. I think it should still also force full `tap` clones, for what it's worth, as you cannot create pull-requests from a shallow clone.\r\n\r\n> I'm not in favor of this PR\r\n> Here's just one example of why this PR is problematic.\r\n\r\n@ilovezfs If you have multiple reasons/examples: please elaborate, thanks.\r\n",

But yes making this a separate variable rather than overloading HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER addresses most of my concerns. Tying it to tapping would be fine I guess as long as there's an opt out envvar specifically for that. It also might be worth having it retroactively trigger an unshallowing of core.\r\n\r\nIt does not address what tdsmith already pointed out, which is the fact that brew behavior can then differ seemingly randomly between machines since this mechanism is tied only to the particular user account on a given machine. I think that will be confusing if people expect the developer behavior (since it was magically enabled for them at some point) and now it's not behaving that way and stashing changes behind their back.\r\n\r\nIt also does not address the problem that dog fooding non-developer homebrew update behavior for an extended period (without something like a HOMEBREW_NO_DEVELOPER available) would require deliberately avoiding any of the trip wires that flip it on without you explicitly asking for it.\r\n\r\nFrom a review of the sources, here's what using a separate variable does indeed address in terms of unrelated behavior changes that would be avoided by that proposal:\r\n\r\n- prerelease xcode warning is skipped\r\n\r\n- deprecation exceptions all become die\r\n\r\n- commands with destructive options (e.g., test-bot) are unleashed on a whole new population for whom they were never intended\r\n\r\n- failed fetches are hard failures rather than falling through to source builds\r\n\r\n- go formulae will refuse to install and odie if they attempt to stage an empty resource array\r\n\r\n- macho parse errors all lead to a raise and a highly technical warning about failing to read Mach-O binaries\r\n\r\n- taps become tappable that would otherwise cause hard failures for users due to invalid syntax\r\n\r\n- formula unavailable errors become raises\r\n\r\n- every install will cause audit_installed to be called before it completes",

And `gcc6` is a different formula, so it gets installed under `/usr/local/Cellar/gcc6/<version>`. So, I can come up with this scenario:\r\nYou had installed both `gcc` and `gcc6` (both have `c++6` binary so even before upgrade your `brew doctor` would probably warn you) and then `gcc` got outdated, you upgraded it and cleaned it up, but nothing changed too much. You still have two formulae with similar binaries. It's up to you to choose which one to link and the behaviour you got is expected.\r\n\r\n> Now the question is should I be doing the --overwrite or just remove gcc6?\r\n\r\nWell, I think you should decide which of two formulae you need i.e. `gcc` or `gcc6`. And link it. But I'm not sure it'll fix the `brew doctor` warning. Uninstalling one of them should fix it.\r\n\r\n",

(I wasn't too enthusiastic because although I love shell scripting, I'm a hardcore Zsh user üòÑ ).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@elyscape A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Globbing needs to be guarded by error checking (whether there are files in the cellar or whether the cellar even exists) ‚Äî especially necessary when `failglob` option is set; unfortunately I don't have a good native solution for checking emptiness, everything I can thing of requires forking.\r\n\r\n2. You're calling `brew --cellar` twice which is unnecessary, save it to a variable if you do need it twice.\r\n\r\n3. To get a list of basenames you can simply do `\"${filepaths[*]##*/}\"` which should be robust in all cases; no need for another `$(brew --cellar)` or `$logdir`.\r\n\r\n4. In order to be robust I would also set `IFS` locally everywhere, but maybe some people will find it an overkill.\r\n\r\nIn general, writing robust shell scripts is not easy, and Bash doesn't make it any easier (no nulls in strings, for instance). After thinking this through, I think `command ls` is reasonable after all; any added robustness will be defeated by the `-W` option to `complete` anyway.\r\n\r\nSo my conclusion is: let's switch to the simple `command ls` version, but make sure the cellar and the logdir exists (``[[ -d dir ]]``) before doing so.

See `locale(1)`.\r\n\r\nViewed the other way, `LANG` is the primary definition, and the others are just overrides, and `LC_ALL` is an override for the overrides. It doesn't really matter; I just find a single `LANG` variable feels cleaner.\r\n\r\n> Isn't `C` the well-defined POSIX locale? \r\n\r\nYes, `C` is the well-defined `POSIX` locale, but not all characters (well, byte sequences, really) are well-defined under that locale. Specifically, only the \"Portable Character Set\" (basically, the characters for 7-bit ASCII, and their corresponding encodings) is defined under POSIX. Other character/encoding values are technically undefined, and will have system-dependent behavior. Most libraries and applications will treat them as opaque values and assume a single-byte encoding (basically, doing the C `char` thing or treating it as binary data), but that's not required by POSIX, and some implementations may differ. In particular, when `ruby` is running under `C`, it will treat byte values over 127 as invalid encodings and throw an error when encountering them. (I'd guess because Ruby comes from Japan, and most of the rest of Unix comes from America, where non-English encodings are less of a concern.)\r\n\r\nThe POSIX locale is a minimal locale intended for portability, not one that handles everything in some uniform way.\r\n\r\nYeah, I have done a lot of locale and character-encoding work. Trust me that this is a rabbit hole we could go down forever before getting back to Homebrew's env sanitization. :smile:",

Xcode 8 contains SDKs that are incompatible with earlier toolchains. Developers who want to make use of the Xcode 8 SDKs from the command line must choose the SDK with `xcode-select`. Developers on OS X El Capitan who have installed versions of the Command Line Tools (OS X 10.11) for Xcode 8 Beta should install Command Line Tools (OS X 10.11) for Xcode 7.3.1. (28234439)\r\n> * On OS X El Capitan, running Swift from the command line can fail if any Command Line Tools (OS X 10.11) package is installed on the system. (28234754)\r\n>\r\n>  Workaround: Execute Swift through from the command line using `xcrun`, . Choose the macOS SDK using the `-sdk`. For example, the following command compiles the file `main.swift`:\r\n>\r\n>  `xcrun -sdk macosx swiftc main.swift`\r\n\r\nShould Homebrew have any special handling for this?  What I get from this is that the version of the command-line tools installed inside the Xcode bundle were updated properly if you are on OS X v10.11.x 'El Capitan' and installed Xcode v8, so `xcodebuild`, `xcrun`, and friends still run properly even though the stand-alone command-line developer tools don't exist for Xcode v8.

I don't see this warning removed any time soon.\r\n\r\nI'm probably not in the position to say this, but testing anything other than `/usr/local` requires extra code, extra manpower, extra CI infrastructure, and extra _ (fill in blank here). I don't think it's feasible, at least not at the moment.\r\n\r\n> specifically track bugs related to this issue should they arise\r\n\r\nYou can report them. We'll try to squash bugs if we can, of course.\r\n\r\n> make ~/.homebrew the new default instead of /usr/local (linuxbrew got this right with ~/.linuxbrew)\r\n\r\nI don't see this happening. Linuxbrew didn't get it *right*, it's just an unfortunate *workaround* on multiuser systems for users who are not sudoers and who cannot (or don't bother to) convince their sysadmins to install the software they need. Having a gigantic `~/.linuxbrew` in every user's home is ridiculous, and sysadmins hate it.\r\n\r\n*By the way, this is very very clearly rejected in https://github.com/Homebrew/brew-evolution/blob/master/commonly_rejected_proposals.md.*\r\n\r\n> concurrent homebrew installs\r\n\r\nThat's possible today. I do it, many maintainers do it. Just don't expect bottles in many/most cases, and don't expect official support (but let me repeat myself, we do try to help when we can).\r\n\r\n> /usr/local actually can interfere with other packages installed on mac, eg when user does make && make install it'll install there.\r\n\r\nPick a different prefix ahead of time when you install random things (and keep in mind that they can still write to wherever they want even if you tell them to write to a certain prefix ‚Äî which is why we enabled sandboxing). You don't complain about apt, rpm or yum installing to /usr because they own /usr. We can't own /usr, so we instead own /usr/local. This stuff is all in [FAQ](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md#why-does-homebrew-prefer-i-install-to-usrlocal). If you disagree, you should probably choose a different package manager, like MacPorts.\r\n\r\n> /usr/local often require special privileges\r\n\r\nInstall to somewhere else then. Again, it's been possible for a long time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOverall, we're a very small team, and we have enough things on our hands already, so sorry. What you're proposing here is a gazillion times easier said than done. Not saying it's impossible to happen at some point in the future, but don't anticipate it.\r\n",

We do support Homebrew in other locations (and are actually working on making that more flexible), but for technical reasons and resource limitations, getting that to \"100% support\" is infeasible.\r\n\r\nThe core code is written to support \"prefixes\" at arbitrary locations. I and other maintainers do run Homebrew at non-default installation locations. And your rationale makes sense, especially for concurrent Homebrew installs.\r\n\r\nIf you run in to bugs when running Homebrew at a non-default location, go ahead and report them. They will be tracked and handled as first-class bugs (though some might be un-fixable).\r\n\r\nBut there's no way we can get the quality of installations at non-default locations to the same level as the default location. That's what's actually tested in our testing infrastructure, and is used by probably the vast majority of our users, so it has a lot more eyes on it. (And some packages have dependencies specifically on `/usr/local`, unfortunately. We try to eliminate those when we find them.) \r\n\r\nConservative users who want to minimize their risk of breakage, or who want to maximize the benefit of bottles, will want to stick with the default installation location. And we want to make that clear in our documentation. So I think the warning will remain.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend installing under a user's home directory by default. Homebrew on OS X expects and intends to be a system-level package manager.\r\n\r\nOverall: We basically want what you want, it's mostly supported, but we can't get *100%* there, and want to make that very clear to users who might care.",

As a result, any binary packages that hard-code locations inside them (rather a lot, unfortunately) need a hard-coded location.\r\n\r\n> /usr/local actually can interfere with other packages installed on mac, eg when user does make && make install it'll install there. Seperating out what's from homebrew vs not in that folder can be a pain, if not impossible when some files are overwritten (eg: http://blog.mact.me/2015/05/15/so-you-want-to-move-your-homebrew-folder)\r\n\r\nThis blog post is inaccurate if you use the current installer: https://github.com/homebrew/install\r\n\r\nThe new default location is `/usr/local/Homebrew` for the Homebrew repository (e.g. the source code, taps, `README.md`, etc.` and `/usr/local` for the Homebrew prefix (e.g. where the symlinks are made, where the `Cellar` is).

This is really nicely working for Composer, not sure if it'd be good for Homebrew.\r\n\r\nIn short I really like the use of non-stable and stable tags which Composer does and hope Homebrew does something like that.",

(That's also why `rubocop --auto-gen-config` copied existing `Exclude`s from `.rubocop.yml` when generating `.rubocop_todo.yml`.)\r\n\r\nThe most elegant solution I found for this is the following `.rubocop.yml` file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ninherit_from:\r\n  - .rubocop_real.yml\r\n  - .rubocop_todo.yml\r\n\r\nAllCops:\r\n  TargetRubyVersion: 2.0\r\n  Exclude:\r\n    - 'Homebrew/cask/**/*'\r\n    - 'Homebrew/vendor/**/*'\r\n    - 'Homebrew/test/vendor/**/*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `.rubocop_real.yml` contains the rest of what previously resided in `.rubocop.yml` (modulo the `inherit_from:` and the `AllCops:` elements).\r\n\r\nAfter making these changes:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ rubocop --debug -DES\r\nFor /opt/brewery/dummy/Library/Homebrew: configuration from /opt/brewery/dummy/Library/.rubocop.yml\r\nInheriting configuration from /opt/brewery/dummy/Library/.rubocop_real.yml\r\nDefault configuration from /Users/martin/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rubocop-0.41.2/config/default.yml\r\nInheriting configuration from /Users/martin/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rubocop-0.41.2/config/enabled.yml\r\nInheriting configuration from /Users/martin/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rubocop-0.41.2/config/disabled.yml\r\nInheriting configuration from /opt/brewery/dummy/Library/.rubocop_todo.yml\r\nUnprocessable file /opt/brewery/dummy/Library/Homebrew/test/fs_leak_log: EOFError, end of file reached\r\nInspecting 324 files\r\n[‚Ä¶]\r\n\r\n324 files inspected, no offenses detected\r\nFinished in 41.937767 seconds\r\n\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```",

		"body" : "Ugh. After changing the permissions on those directories to make them group read-only (as above), Homebrew started raising errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Failed to link all completions, docs and manpages:\r\n  Permission denied - /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions` is owned by `root:admin` and to satisfy compaudit, not group writable. I'd really rather not _force_ the issue by simply claiming user ownership of that directory - after all, it's not in my home directory, and could easily be used by another user logged into the system.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to rely on the group membership to grant write permission.\r\n\r\nI did find that I could restore group write to that directory and the errors in Homebrew went away.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\r\n$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/share/zsh\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also double-checked and the issue with compinit is not recurring.\r\n\r\nSo I also restored group write to the Cellar folders, but doing so brings back the corruption to `.zcompdump` and the failure in subsequent shell launches.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh  \r\n$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh/functions\r\n$ zsh\r\n$ zsh\r\ncompdump () {\r\n\t# undefined\r\n\tbuiltin autoload -XUz\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems I can continue to work around the issue by leaving the /usr/local/share directories group writable and the /usr/local/Cellar directories not group writable. Interestingly, as the Cellar directories are owned by me, they won't need to be group writable to function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo chmod g-w /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh         \r\n$ sudo chmod g-w /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh/functions\r\n$ ls -lad /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh/functions\r\ndrwxr-xr-x    5 jaraco  admin    170 Dec  3  2015 /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  982 jaraco  admin  33388 Apr 15 05:46 /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.2/share/zsh/functions\r\n$ whoami\r\njaraco\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I'm able to work around the issue with what feels like a delicate balance of adjustments to the permissions, and I still don't know what's causing the underlying corruption to .zcompdump, though it does seem to be related to group write permissions on `/usr/local/Cellar/...`.",

I _think_ (but haven't researched, this is a hunch) that we're not seeing a lot of the potential for speedup because parallel_tests will try to spread different tests across different processes, but different tests in the same file are always grouped together. When I look at the output, I get four processes. Three finish at the same time, and one goes on much longer, slowing things down. That final process is the one that runs `test_integration_cmds`. So, if we split that up into smaller files, we'd probably get a much bigger speed up.",

On my ancient Core 2 Duo machine I get this: `2 processes for 77 tests, ~ 38 tests per process`. As @penman says, the gem apportions tests proportionately across cores _by file_. For me, the first process exits after 29s and the other one - with the integration tests - after 190s - so not getting full benefit of @penman's excellent work!

There's nothing wrong with enabling this behavior in brew at all times. The problem is having long and almost useless environment variables at all times in your environment. Every environment variable is part of `envv[]` that counts toward `ARG_MAX`, which is 262144 on Darwin. Having a single 34 character long environment variable may not be too big a deal, but when every piece of software asks you to set a bunch of junk, they do add up to something considerable. Currently my `env | wc -c` is around 5000 and I don't even have many variables set. I would try hard to avoid more bloat and I urge software developers to be considerate. Keep in mind, this is not unlimited resource (unlike another CPU cycle).\r\n\r\n> If performance is the concern, I'd be very, very shocked to find that one more shellvar has more of a negative effect than yet another git-config call.\r\n\r\nIf you care about performance no that front you probably want to optimize Ruby away.\r\n\r\n> how will the user who has asked for the warnings to be suppressed change her mind? \r\n\r\nI doubt it.

We're having similar problems over at CircleCI, and can't force users to upgrade their formulae or Xcode versions.\r\n\r\nA potential solution would be the discussed explicit `--no-xcode-check`, or adding a generic `CI` env var check, but this could break users local workflows (Especially for Swift Formulae that may not work on latest Xcode yet, like [SwiftLint](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/303660134f72cffaef94f87abfb6bfeedccc0e1c/Formula/swiftlint.rb)).\r\n\r\nI'm more than happy to contribute a PR for this, but I'm not sure which approach the team would rather see.",

There may even be a critical update to something that she needs to brew right away, but can't because she is still waiting until she can install the latest Xcode.\r\n\r\nI think we can keep old Xcodes being fatal so long as (a) the commit that kills a given Xcode is always  tagged, and (b) in the fatality warning message we either provide clear and visible instructions on how she can use `git` to revert to the `brew` tag immediately prior to the one that killed her Xcode, or inform her that setting HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER will get her out of jail, or both.\r\n",

This morning I had time to either try to smooth some of this over with people (including myself) who were unimpressed with the reaction or to try to fix the issue.

We support CLT-only as best as we can, and almost all `xcode` dependencies are `:build` only. There are some notable exceptions, but we try to support CLT-only as widely as possible.\r\n\r\n> Suggestion: Could this maybe be a warning, rather than an error?\r\n\r\nNo. It was a warning, and to be honest I pretty quickly got sick of the default fix for a 10.12 bug reported to us being _\"You need to update Xcode. `brew doctor` has warned you about this\"_.\r\n\r\nThis causes both users and us real, significant problems & takes up time that could and should be used solving problems that aren't entirely user configuration based. Apple themselves say do not use Xcode 7.2.1 on 10.12, it isn't supported, it will break stuff if used. We didn't magic up the requirement.\r\n\r\nNote that the only configuration that is flagged as of the last tag being cut is running < Xcode 8 on 10.12. That's all.",

There are some notable exceptions, but we try to support CLT-only as widely as possible.\r\n\r\nHmm.  This is interesting.  Just to clarify: am I right in reading this to mean that: \r\n\r\n1.  there is some subset of the stuff brew does for which Xcode is a real dependency, but that subset is fairly small, and \r\n\r\n2. as long as one is asking brew to carry out tasks for which Xcode isn't a real dependency, it'll happily carry them out *so long as there is no Xcode at all on one's system*, but will throw a fatal error and refuse to carry them out *if there is the wrong Xcode on one's system*?  \r\n\r\nIf that's true, then at the very least this really needs to be documented in some readily accessible place. For example, the error that I ran into should actually provide this information, so that there aren't hordes of people polluting their poor machines with Xcode 8 and god only knows what nightmarish installation issues and bugs that creates *just to get package management working again when they don't actually need to.*  \r\n\r\nIf I understood you right, I'll happy submit the trivial PR myself to change the error message.  (I'll also gleefully get rid of Xcode on my own machine and start popping champagne.)  But first I want to make sure that I'm understanding you right. \r\n\r\nThe real problem here isn't brew---it's an amazing tool, supported by a wonderful community. The real problem, frankly, is that Xcode is horrible. But it will seriously hurt the brew community if people think, even inaccurately, that they're forced to get their paws on Xcode 8 in order to use brew at all.  \r\n\r\n",

If you have them installed, though, you need to have them be up-to-date to avoid complaining as otherwise things may break. \r\n\r\nWe may consider changing our messaging in future but I'd like to see more widespread evidence of this being an issue first.\r\n\r\nThanks for filing the issue and I hope this has helped.\r\n",

This is however not the only issue that has been occurring in the php tap which lead to the revision of the bottles. As an example brew migrated to a new directory structure recently and we discovered that a hardcoded link to the old structure was located in the phpize script in all php versions so that we were no longer able to compile extensions and bottle them. This prevented us from providing Sierra support and meant that the bottles needed to be rebuilt after the underlying issue with the phpize script had been resolved.\r\n\r\nAs for the issues you bring up I hear you but there are a lot of people that upgrade to Sierra so I believe it is important for us to provide bottles also for the new version of the operating system near to its release. Your second issue I believe is hard to change since it part of the design of brew. Some Formulas have external dependencies to other Formulas and the the dependency is updated the bottle has to be rebuilt or the Formula will be broken. It is not so much that it a bottled is added or removed but the revision that is changed which triggers the reinstall/compile to happen.\r\n\r\nSo in short this is not a solution to your issues but if you have further issues, ideas or code suggestions feel free to send a PR our way (in the php tap) and we can take it from there.",

There is no `libXt.7.dylib` in this version.\r\n\r\nHere's the libs from XQuartz 2.7.9:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ otool -hv libXt.6.dylib libXt.7.dylib\r\nlibXt.6.dylib:\r\nMach header\r\n      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags\r\nMH_MAGIC_64  X86_64        ALL  0x00       DYLIB    19       2024 DYLDLINK NO_REEXPORTED_DYLIBS APP_EXTENSION_SAFE\r\nlibXt.7.dylib:\r\nMach header\r\n      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags\r\nMH_MAGIC_64  X86_64        ALL  0x00       DYLIB    19       2024   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL NO_REEXPORTED_DYLIBS APP_EXTENSION_SAFE\r\n```\r\n\r\nI downgraded XQuartz from 2.7.9 to 2.7.8, reinstalled `openmotif` and `grace` from source, and it's working now: running `xmgrace` launches the GUI instead of just crashing.\r\n\r\nSo this was probably caused by XQuartz being upgraded on the test-bot servers. I suspect the first time that an openmotif bottle was built against 2.7.9, it linked to the two-level-namespace `libXt.7.dylib`, and @ltbuchman picked it up on a subsequent update.\r\n\r\nSo I think we need to massage the build to get it to link against the flat-namespace versions of `libXt.dylib` instead of the defaults ‚Äì I'll see if I can figure that out ‚Äì and push for OpenMotif upstream to add compatibility with two-level-namespace dylibs (however that's done; beyond me at this point).\r\n\r\n@ltbuchman, as a workaround for the time being, try making sure you have XQuartz 2.7.8 installed (not 2.7.9 or 2.7.10_rc4), and reinstall `openmotif` and `grace` from source with `brew reinstall -s openmotif grace`.",

Maybe just:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if ARGV.include? \"--repair\"\r\n      Tap.each(&:link_manpages)\r\n      Tap.each(&:link_completions)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's also a [section in `brew update-report`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/564fa8867dd865c686d243ba48c202e0cb6a35fe/Library/Homebrew/cmd/update-report.rb#L297-L306) that deals with completion symlinks. Maybe that should be refactored to use `Tap#link_completions` instead of separate `link_src_dst_dirs` calls? (That would make the `fish` completion linking behavior consistent between `brew tap` and `brew update`, too.) Seems to me that whole `link_completions_and_docs` may belong in `Tap` instead of `update-report`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def link_completions_and_docs(repository = HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY)\r\n    command = \"brew update\"\r\n    link_src_dst_dirs(repository/\"completions/bash\",\r\n                      HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"etc/bash_completion.d\", command)\r\n    link_src_dst_dirs(repository/\"docs\",\r\n                      HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"share/doc/homebrew\", command, link_dir: true)\r\n    link_src_dst_dirs(repository/\"completions/zsh\",\r\n                      HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"share/zsh/site-functions\", command)\r\n    link_src_dst_dirs(repository/\"manpages\",\r\n                      HOMEBREW_PREFIX/\"share/man/man1\", command)\r\n```",

The idea, from the start really, was that brew install boost gets you the latest boost.\r\n\r\nWhat you seem to be proposing is that it doesn't get you the latest `boost` until we've deleted the current `boost` formula?\r\n\r\n> Obviously, that has proven impractical because if you rename the existing boost for example you have to rebuild every single formula that brew uses it, which in many cases is going to lead to enormous CI and user burden. But I think the situation where we rename the current formula and have the alias pointing at the oldest boost is a mistake.\r\n\r\nI don't propose the alias points at the oldest boost, just the one that we use by default and we shouldn't use it by default until we've fixed our dependencies such that we can use it. The mass-rebuild in this case would be a one-time thing for the rename whereas it's currently required every time.\r\n\r\n> I don't think we need to migrate to the new system overnight, and in fact we get more stability out of things if we don't. As I outlined earlier, using the experience from my work on openssl@1.1 and ILZ's work on boost recently, I think the best process is a gradual move towards deleting the original formula and replacing it at that point with an alias.\r\n\r\nI don't think we are proposing moving to it overnight.

		"body" : "> I do think we've overcomplicated this. The idea, from the start really, was that brew install boost gets you the latest boost.\r\n\r\nWhat you seem to be proposing is that it doesn't get you the latest `boost` until we've deleted the current `boost` formula?\r\n\r\n> Obviously, that has proven impractical because if you rename the existing boost for example you have to rebuild every single formula that brew uses it, which in many cases is going to lead to enormous CI and user burden. But I think the situation where we rename the current formula and have the alias pointing at the oldest boost is a mistake.\r\n\r\nI don't propose the alias points at the oldest boost, just the one that we use by default and we shouldn't use it by default until we've fixed our dependencies such that we can use it. The mass-rebuild in this case would be a one-time thing for the rename whereas it's currently required every time.\r\n\r\n> I don't think we need to migrate to the new system overnight, and in fact we get more stability out of things if we don't. As I outlined earlier, using the experience from my work on openssl@1.1 and ILZ's work on boost recently, I think the best process is a gradual move towards deleting the original formula and replacing it at that point with an alias.\r\n\r\nI don't think we are proposing moving to it overnight.

		"body" : "I'm not completely sure you read my comment through in its entirety because some of the stuff you raised conflicts with stuff I'd already outlined above, especially the statement that removing `boost.rb` later down the line will break third-party taps. I explicitly stated in my original comment that removing `boost.rb` would be immediately followed up by adding a `boost` alias pointing to the latest available `boost@x.y` formula at the time, which completely facilitates `depends_on \"boost\"` being possible.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and admit my system is full of issues, but I think your's is as well to be honest, such as the built-in system where `boost@1.63.rb` goes in as `keg_only` and then relatively soon after stops being `keg_only`, which mandates a revision bump, so you're likely to give folks a `boost@1.63` installation and then whomp them again fairly quickly with a rebuild. That's not such a huge issue given the `cellar :any`, but increasingly unless we make strides on `cellar :any` that could become punishing to non-`/usr/local` users. It also kind of sucks for users on slower or more limited internet connections than we can afford to enjoy ourselves.\r\n\r\nNeither of us have touched on the issue of orphaned formulae, which are going to become quite a bit more common as we go ahead and purge anything outside of +/-2 major versions that is no longer depended upon. `boost` is a good >400MB installation, ending up in a situation where multiple versions are installed and the formulae for some of those are no longer present is less than ideal on disk space & UX. This is already an issue today but it will be a bigger issue as we start mandating adding extra versioned installations of the same formula locally.\r\n\r\nBut look, life is short and I don't expect a ton of movement here however compelling or awful an argument I piece together, so I'm not going to invest a lot more energy into this.
